Before the exhaustion got really bad, my vision was incredible.  I could see people's faces two blocks ahead of me without issue.  Now, it's a lot worse.  I was prescribed glasses, but my vision shifts too much to make them useful.  It's like my eyes are too tired to focus.\n\nI also get sick very easily.\n\nI'm not really overweight.  I'm 6ft and only 135lbs, so I don't think that's the issue.\n\nI apparently have mild sleep apnea, but not bad enough to warrant a CPAP machine.  In the sleep apnea test, they also told me that I don't get REM sleep.  Even with that info, we haven't been able to do anything.  My body seems to be ultra-resistant to meds, so sleeping pills haven't done anything.  Ambien just made me peppier and the others I took (don't remember off the top of my head) didn't even make me tired.  \n\nHell, stimulants don't work either.  I was given Adderall XR, Vyvanse, Ritalin, and another one (I think), all to no avail.  The only one that gave me a bit of energy was the XR, but after the first two days it stopped working.\n\nOne of my doctors says I have Chronic Fatigue, but isn't really offering solutions on how to fix it.\n\nI'm just sick and tired of being sick and tired.\n\nHow can I feel rested and awake?  I just want to feel energetic again.  I'm also running out of time, as I need to take tests for college and other things, and I need to be awake for them.\nDoctor: <br><br><br><big><strong>Options for a follow-up question</strong></big><br>A.
