I have taken Tylenol since I measured and wonder if I should go to the ER. I am  very light headed when I stand up and the above symptoms I mentioned earlier. I am also sore in my abdomen and hamstrings but I believe this is from working out two days ago (I targeted these muscles). I don't like to go to the doctor unnecessarily but I am a little concerned since I am by myself and have never had a fever this high before. Thanks for any replies\n\n\n\nEDIT: Temp is down to 103.5 since this initial reading\nDoctor: <br><br><br><big><strong>Options for a follow-up question</strong></big><br>A.
