She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because \u2018that\u2019s how babies are designed \u2018 , but they didn\u2019t see it , they didn\u2019t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things.<br>Nevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn\u2019t of helped her.<br>Fast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.<br>Now here\u2019s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree! <br>Now me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can\u2019t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise. I genuinely don\u2019t know how I am meant to cope with this fear that she is going to die any second, I can\u2019t enjoy any time with her because I\u2019m so stressed even though I want to be able to enjoy being with her I just can\u2019t over the past few days.

Blood test gave no indications.<br>Over the past year or so, I've noticed that my overall health has slowly but noticeably declined. My symptoms are basically, fatigue, weakness, bowel issues (constipation/ diarrhea), bloating/ swelling in lower abdomen legs chest and upper arms. Recently, I have started to notice some weight gain but seems mostly to be the bloating.  If anything I feel like I am having atrophy, my neck and arms feel thinner. I have a really active lifestyle as an avid runner and eat a pretty clean diet. I have even taken extra steps to avoid processed, gluten, FODMAPs all kinds of things to help. <br>I had an extensive blood test about a week ago. The results basically said that there was nothing wrong with my blood. If anything, I should be quite healthy. Problem is I feel like a shell of myself, maybe 50-60% as good as I did only a year ago. It is a little scary I can not get any answers from blood tests and I am hoping the good health professionals of reddit can help me look in the right direction.<br>For reference, I am a 27yo Male, about 5'10'' and ~140lbs (keep in mind I run competatively, or did before this started) <br><strong>Clinical Conversation</strong><br>Doctor Question: Have you noticed problems with maintaining interest in things you use to enjoy?<br>Patient Response: I have absolutely had some pretty serious depression the past several months with all the issues you mentioned.

Physical health changes are completely unrelated to mood, so addressing depression generally has no impact on physical symptoms.<br>C.

It spread down his entire body throughout the day. That night he spiked a fever, 102, but went away with ibuprofen. Upon waking, rash is more pronounced and his face is slightly swollen, loose stools- not quite diarrhea. Still has a fever, but it responds to ibuprofen. Facial swelling diminishes throughout the day. Seems to be getting a dry cough. He is still very uncomfortable without ibuprofen but acts normal when it kicks in. He is eating and drinking enough to not worry about dehydration. Next day is pretty much the same, but rash looks better and he seems better. Today, the rash is still very much there but less pronounced. He seems more comfortable, but not his normal self. Eating better, but not his normal amount.

This started out as what was thought to be some atypical migraine - severe pain behind the eye that would sometimes shoot down to the ear that simply would not go away. Occasional nausea but no symptoms aside from that. Day 4 she went to urgent care and received IM Zofran and 60mg IM Toradol. This helped greatly.....for about 18 hours. Day 7 she couldn\u2019t take it anymore and went to the ER (the wait for the ER was because she was uninsured and open season for insurance for my company was literally in 8 days). So they do a CT scan. Everyone\u2019s affect immediately changes, they begin doing q1min neuro checks, me being and RN myself my heart drops to the floor. The MD comes in and says the found what look to be some bleeding and they\u2019re transferring her to a trauma hospital immediately... fast forward to the trauma facility the MRI shows a spontaneous subdural hematoma. The kicker is they simply cannot find the cause. No clots, no anuersym, no vascular abnormalities, no trauma, no medications taken regularly, no medical history whatsoever aside from ovarian cysts. So neurosurgery and hematology run every lab in the book. EVERYTHING is normal (we\u2019re still waiting on some specific clotting factor tests). Everyones stumped. The bleed doesn\u2019t even completely correspond to where her pain is. Shes in excruciating pain that is responding somewhat to Fioricet and IV Decadron Q8H. They monitor the bleed with repeat CTs and it\u2019s stable. So fast forward 4 days later here we are home. With no answers.

After having bloodwork done while sick, it\u2019s come to light that my CRP level spiked to 49.9, and then back down to 0.77 when I\u2019m healthy.<br>Hello everyone,<br>I\u2019m sorry for the long title, I just wanted to get as much info in as I could. My name is Aaron, I\u2019m a 24 year old male, and I live in Canada. <br>For as far back as I can remember, I\u2019ve been sick what I felt has been way more often than any of my friends. I didn\u2019t realize at the time, but every single time I\u2019ve been sick (aside from maybe the odd cold?) has been the EXACT SAME symptoms - this includes a fever of typically 38.9, a very sore throat, congestion, and a cough.<br>Initially, my mom and I believed I was constantly getting strep throat over and over again, so I would be treated as if it was and it would eventually go away. Like I said I don\u2019t have a ton of memory on everything back then because I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time.<br>Then, we come to the last few years. I started to notice the pattern about 2 years ago when I first met my girlfriend. I got extremely sick like I usually do on New Years, and it lasted a couple of weeks like it usually does - but about 3 weeks later, I got sick again. Same symptoms. Fast forward to February, about a month later, I\u2019m sick again with the same symptoms. March, about a month later again - same symptoms. April, about 3 weeks later, I\u2019m sick again with the same symptoms as always.<br>It was around this time that my mom and I noticed that nobody ever gets sick from me. I\u2019m never, ever contagious - it almost seems like my body\u2019s reaction to something rather than an illness. <br>This pattern continued for about a year, up until last New Years when I got sick again. I finally had enough and I decided to go to a walk in and explain my situation. I met a doctor who finally was willing to look into what this could be, rather than just marking it off as a cold or strep throat. He gave me some forms to get bloodwork done once when I was healthy, and again when I was sick. <br>I waited until I was sick to get my bloodwork done, but, to my surprise, I didn\u2019t get sick this year until about 9 months later. Come October, sure enough i was sick with the same symptoms as always. I got my bloodwork done while I was sick, and to my surprise all of my results came back normal EXCEPT - I had a CRP level of 49.9. I\u2019m lucky enough to be dating and living with my girlfriend who is a Registered Nurse, and she explained to me that a high CRP level indicates some sort of swelling in the body, and could really be chalked up to anything.<br>So, when I was healthy, I went back to get my blood work done. After getting it done, I went back into the same walk in clinic and spoke with the doctor who was willing to look into what it could be.<br>He explained to me that my CRP had spiked to 49.9 while I was sick, and had fallen back down to 0.77 while I was healthy. He said that usually with something like a cold or the flu, you could expect to see CRP levels of 13 or so due to a cough or a sore throat causing some swelling - but he said because it spiked to high, he thinks we could be on the right track and it could be something else.<br>One thing we\u2019re looking into is something called Periodic Fever Syndrome. This is usually (rarely) found in children, and typically doesn\u2019t last until adulthood. Some adults however can even more rarely be diagnosed with this.<br>With all of that being said, that brings me to today. I was sick about a month ago, and surprise surprise I\u2019m sick again. Last night my fever started out at around 37.9 when I noticed it, and I woke up about an hour and a half ago with a fever of 38.8 (Celsius of course). <br>I\u2019m going to wait a few days, and when whatever this is is at its peak, I\u2019m going to get bloodwork again to see if my CRP spikes back up again. If it does, the doctor said he will most likely try to treat it as if it\u2019s Periodic Fever Syndrome:<br>The reason I\u2019m writing in is to see if anyone else has something like this, or if any doctors have any opinions or insight they would be willing to share. <br>I\u2019m so tired of being constantly sick. It\u2019s effected many jobs as I have to call in sick, it effects my day to day and general happiness, and I just want it to stop. <br>Thank you for reading all of this.<br><strong>Clinical Conversation</strong><br>Doctor Question: Do you smoke?<br>Patient Response: I don\u2019t smoke<br>Doctor Question: Do you live somewhere with mold or at least very damp?<br>Patient Response: As far as I know there\u2019s no mold or dampness here<br>Doctor Question: Do you have a healthy diet?<br>Patient Response: My diet is okay but I could definitely cut out the junk food<br>Doctor Question: How often are you exercising?<br>Patient Response: None<br>Doctor Question: How is your sleep schedule?<br>Patient Response: My sleep schedule is definitely not the best, it sometimes takes me until 2 am to fall asleep<br>Doctor Question: Have you ever gotten a throat swab?<br>Patient Response: As for throat swabs, I\u2019ve definitely had my fair share.

But the thermometer always show 37\u00baC (98.6\u00baF)  <br>I remember when it was winter here around mid july, I had to leave 5 in the morning, it was 5\u00baC (41\u00baF), my hair was wet, really windy, and all I had on was a shirt, t-shirt and jeans, the shirt which I had to remove later.  <br>When it's a bit cold (between 10\u00baC and 15\u00baC) I get really hyped up and can get a lot of stuff done. When it's hot (anything above 20\u00baC) I feel extremely sluggish, and when it hits 30\u00baC, I honestly can't do anything, moving my body becomes a hassle and simple things (like taking a shower or going grocery shopping) makes me either have to rest every 5 minutes or makes me collapse.  <br>I don't seem to sweat as much as expected from the heat I seem to feel.  <br>My weight also hasn't changed in the last 7 years, doesn't matter how much of a lazy couch potato or healthy crossfitter I try to be.<br>*ps. I am sorry if this only seemed like a rant, but I don't know how to explain exactly how I feel.*  <br>*pss. I am sorry for any grammar mistakes, haven't been able to practive my english as much.*<br>I will try to answer any questions and update any useful info requested. <br>**Thank you!**<br><strong>Clinical Conversation</strong><br>Doctor Question: All your blood tests were 'excessively normal'?
