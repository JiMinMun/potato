At their worst, it feels like I'm being stabbed in my right (or, less often, left) scapula. Usually, however, the pain in that particular area is more of a dull ache, but it's very often there. Also, I've been recently getting faint pins and needles on my right outer forearm and into my fingers, which is a newer symptom.
