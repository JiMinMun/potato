What do I have?<br>A week ago I had a bad cold or maybe the flu. I could barely get out of bed, I had a horrible headache, I was sneezing like crazy and had a small light cough. Three days later, on Saturday, it was all gone. That is except for the cough. somehow, it got worse. It's now Wednesday and I still have it. It comes and goes and it's not so bad I can't do my work or anything. It's more so just annoying. Like hiccups almost. It hasn't gotten any worse or better. Also when I breath hard, I wheeze a little. Drinking non soda's like tea and water seem to help sooth it and help my breathing a little. Sitting up has a similar effect I think. Sometimes, like once or twice a day, it also feels like I have a little \"gunk\" stuck in my throat and I gotta do that weird throat thing to spit it up.
