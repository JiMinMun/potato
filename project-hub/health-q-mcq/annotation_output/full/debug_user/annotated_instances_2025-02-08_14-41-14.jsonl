Drinks (1-2 drinks per day), and occasionally smokes weed. Not on any medications.<br>My boyfriend began having issues with bad breath in college (around 2015). We started dating in 2017. I think he\u2019s a great guy and would hate to end the relationship over this, but it\u2019s been an issue that has really affected our intimacy. We\u2019re moving in together soon, so both of us would love to have this issue solved ASAP...<br>About the problem: He says it began around the same time as he transitioned his diet from that of an offensive lineman on the football team (basically eating whatever/whenever he wanted) to a healthier, more restricted diet. He went to the doctor for it soon after the issue began and was told that it was most likely related to the dietary change, which may have changed the composition of his stomach acid. <br>Since then, he\u2019s been using prescription-strength toothpaste designed to improve breath. But almost five years later the problem still hasn\u2019t improved. He brushes his teeth 2-3 times a day with the \u201cBreathRx\u201d toothpaste. He doesn\u2019t floss regularly, but neither do many people I know, and their breath is nowhere near as bad. <br>Could there be an underlying condition causing this, and is it likely something that can be fixed? What type of doctor would be best for him to go see in person - a dentist? Primary care physician? Someone else? Thanks for any advice!<br>EDIT: initial personal info<br>EDIT: Thank you so much for all the feedback! Bf said he had his adenoids removed when he was younger, but not his tonsils, so tonsil stones are definitely a possibility. He uses a tongue scraper a lot so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s due to to tongue gunk.<br><strong>Clinical Conversation</strong><br>Doctor Question: How was it treated for you?<br>Patient Response: My tonsils were so bad they Disintegrated  it took care of themselves.

I am currently in a hospital bed on a Heparin Drip.  <br>I have Vascular, Hematology, oncology, and even Gastro all stumped.  Basically, I am under attack by blood clots but no one has a clue why.   A year of this.  <br>Long story short - calf DVT 10/20.  Found May Thurner, stent placed, clot resolved, moved on with life.   Taken off thinners. <br>July - spinal surgery.  3 weeks later,  blood clots EVERYWHERE, spent a week in hospital had thrombectomy.  Simple answer - surgery caused clots (even though ive had many surgeries before with no clots).  Put on Xarelto. <br>November - found more clots even on Xarelto.  Do tPA lysis catheter puts me in hospital another week.  Clears clogged stents, put on Lovenox.  <br>2 weeks later - more clots.  Just had another thrombectomy.  <br>I have tested negative for everything.  Negative for all genetic factors, negative for rare clotting disorders.  And yet, here I am.  <br>CT Scan of chest and pelvis no tumors.  Lymph nodes swollen but \"subcentimeter\" in the area where all the clotting keeps happening.  <br>Everyone is stumped.  They won't let me out of the hospital. I feel fine except for my leg which has been through alot.  <br>Only info to go off of - I have been anemic off and on, Monocyte % slighly high, folate very low, absolute immature gran count high.   <br>I am here in the hospital.

I am in generally good health, blood work is always good, I feel physically healthy, exercise sometimes every day, but at least 5 days a week for about an hour a day. No drinking, smoking, drugs, etc. <br>I have started waking up throughout the night. We have a young daughter going through a difficult diagnosis from this summer and I thought I was handling it as well as could be expected but am thinking I am not doing as good as once thought. I wake very panicked and unable to fall back asleep much of the time, instead pacing the house, cleaning, whatever I can do to keep my mind busy. I have noticed that I started also feeling an urge to hold my breath at times and will do it until my chest burns and aches because it strangely makes me feel a little better in the moment. I also feel like something is off, like something bad will happen to us in our home. I look out the blinds a lot at night, feel very skittish about noises. And I know I am being paranoid, but knowing that doesn't help me stop feeling that way. <br>I am starting to dread night time though. <br>I have never been a depressed or anxious person but does this sound like it could be related to those things, especially given that it has come up as we were dealt a difficult hand?

Like I have been managing to make plans with friends from time to time when I get forced into it (hubby answers the phone when it rings and tells them I'm available, or they just drop in), but otherwise find myself avoiding them as well, along with cancelling the plans after I make them because I just lose enthusiasm as the planned event gets closer.
