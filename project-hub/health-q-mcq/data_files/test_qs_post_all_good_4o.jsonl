I know I didn't get smashed because I never drink to the point of being too inebriated (then again I guess my definition of such is different from some but you can just trust me that I don't drink that much when I do.) As far as other drugs, I have been smoking a lot of marijuana lately to help me sleep. It went from like 1 bowl a weekend to help me wake up for the Mondays to 4-5 bowls a day.

I had spells in which the nausea would get worse, and I would experience vomiting and complete loss of appetite.

I'm 31 female 5'7\" 150 lbs and caucasian. Daily I take celexa, wellbutrin, omeprazole, singular, zyrtec and a complete women's multivitamin. All of these I've taken for 2+ years, no new meds added. Existing conditions are asthma, allergies, GERD, depression and anxiety disorder. No change in diet.\nOk, now on to my \"mystery illness\". I'll try to give as much detail as possible. Three weeks ago, I noticed the tops of my feet hurt while walking or bending/flexing my feet. The next day the tops of my hands. A day or two later my ankles and wrists joined. I had no swelling that week until a party that weekend. I was standing a lot and took my shoe off because my right foot felt tight and saw that my foot was very swollen and very painful. Swollen from the ankle down to my toes. The next day, still swollen and barely able to walk on it, I promised my husband I'd go to the family doctor. \nBy the time I could see the doctor, 3 days later, my left wrist and top of my hand was swollen as well. I also started to have pain in my right leg. It was up my leg to my knee. But this was more in the muscles of my leg and the area behind my knee I call my \"knee pit\". I can't bend my wrists, right knee or ankles barely at all. The doctor said she really wasn't sure what to think. I had blood drawn for the typical lab panel as well as one for lyme disease. I told her how much pain I was in. I can barely wash and dry my hair, cook, clean house or work at this point (I use my hands a lot at work for various tedious tasks). I can't even hook my own bra behind my back. I feel pathetic and helpless. She recommend that I use OTC pain relievers. I already knew these haven't helped, but had hopes of getting an answer from the blood tests if wait it out.\nAll of my blood work came back normal, I'm really healthy on paper. At this point I'm very frustrated. She recommended I see a rheumatologist and because of my pleading for relief from this extreme pain, gave me a prescription for tramadol. Later on in the week, I had to call and request something else, tramadol didn't even touch the pain. I feel like they think I'm just asking for random pain killers, they make feel like I'm doing something wrong. But, they prescribed mobic anyway. Still not even worth me taking it. Might as well be a pez candy for all it does. The last few days, a couple fingers have started hurting as well. \nNow, the best way I can describe these pains is comparing it to a sprained wrist/twisted ankle/jammed finger. There is extreme pain when I trip over my dog or bend my wrist while pushing off from my chair to stand. These pains are intense and sharp. Heat or cold packs don't help much, but I've used them on the main swollen areas just for temporary relief.\nI have no history of arthritis or autoimmune disorders in my family. All of my family is really healthy and they think I'm exaggerating. My rheumatoid factor on the lab work was &lt;10 with the cutoff at &lt;=14. \nI can say that I've been under *extreme* stress for months. Money problems and the possibility of losing my house because of these money problems. Because of money issues, I've had anxiety attacks at work and feel fatigued and depressed with all of the problems compounding into an almost explosive situation.

{"goodness": true, "thread_id": "t_cx73m9q-0", "patient_info": "Mystery Stomach Problems Causing Misery :(\n\nHey guys!  Thanks in advance for looking this over, and I apologize for it being so long but I'm really trying to be thorough.  I'm a 27-year-old caucasian female from south FL, approximately 5'2\" and currently 140 lbs.  For the past month and a half I've been experiencing terrible, debilitating nausea and abdominal discomfort.  I also have NO appetite -- just the thought of eating makes me feel nauseous.  When I do try to eat I can only ever manage a few bites before I feel uncomfortably full.  \n\nThe situation escalated to the point where I lost about 8 lbs in a week and a half (went from 150-142) and I finally went to see a GI in mid-October. They performed an ultrasound of my gallbladder (clean!) and also did some blood work, which also came back clean.  The GI prescribed me 10mg dicyclomine to be taken 3 times a day, as well as a week long course of ciprofloxacin.  I responded well to the dicyclomine at first -- my first two days on the pills I felt almost normal.  But it started to have some diminishing returns pretty quickly, so I spoke with my GI and decided to take it four times a day.  Once again, I'm experiencing some diminishing returns and I am now taking dicyclomine five times a day.  He also recommended I take 20g omeprazole twice a day, which I have been doing for several weeks.  I saw him for a followup on Weds and explained I was still experiencing nausea and difficulty eating, so he's now added a probiotic (Align, taken I believe once daily?  I haven't started yet, I ordered the pills online and they should be arriving today) and he suggested taking a Tums before bedtime (which I have done for the last few days, using \"ultra strength\" Tums.)\n\nLike I said, the medication seemed to work at first.  I went from 142 to 144-46, and I was starting to function almost normally.  I still couldn't eat a lot but the nausea seemed to be resolved by the medication.  After a week I had to increase the dosage but it still mostly resolved my nausea.  Things are looking kind of bleak lately though.  I took my morning dose of omeprazole and dicyclomine about two hours ago and I'm still feeling nauseous, although a bit better than I did this morning.  The nausea is bad enough right now that I don't feel like I could function comfortably outside of my apartment.  I'm also starting to lose weight again (which yay, I guess, but I really wanted to get there through proper diet and exercise, not because I can't eat food.)\n\nSome more relevant information: I experienced a similar situation back in March/April where I felt nauseous and unable to eat.  This lasted about 3-4 weeks, and was not nearly as serious as the nausea I experience now.  I just stuck to a diet of simple chicken broth and saltines until my stomach settled, which it eventually did.  I didn't see a doctor for that.  I had also been losing weight intentionally prior to my stomach issues, approximately 25 lbs before these shenanigans began. Back in June I experienced SEVERE, sharp abdominal pain that lasted for about 4-5 days.  I saw the GI back then as well and he said it was likely a gallbladder attack from the weight loss and he gave me a prescription, but by that point I was actually getting better on my own and didn't end up taking the medication.  Eventually the pain went away completely and I was totally fine pretty much until October when this whole mess started.\n\nSince this is a GI problem I should probably discuss my bowel movements.  Mostly it's been kind of inconsistent, probably because of how wildly my eating habits vary lately.  Some mornings I'll produce several large, soft BMs, other days it's almost nothing all day -- small, hard BMs.  Lately it's been almost nothing, I suspect because I'm having so much trouble eating.  But who knows?  Urine seems to be pretty normal, at least to me.  \n\nThe nausea is basically constant but I've only thrown up once this whole time back in October, and what I threw up was literally just a pill and water.  (There was nothing else in my system.)  I feel like if I pushed myself to eat more it would probably end up making me vomit, but I haven't really wanted to try that yet.  Also, the nausea seems to come in waves: it's always present, but sometimes it just gets SO MUCH WORSE before ebbing back to a lower level.  Aside from the nausea I get occasional stomach discomfort (not pain, more like a terrible gnawing sensation, it might just be hunger at this point honestly), fatigue (might be hunger or the dicyclomine), and rarely I get chills (again, probably hunger).  Also, when I went to the GI on Weds it took them a LONG time to get a blood pressure reading for me.  Multiple attempts on each arm, until finally the fifth time the nurse wrapped the sleeve around my forearm and managed to get a reading.  I don't recall what it was but the nurse didn't comment on it, so I'm assuming it was within normal range.  She said the difficulty getting a reading on my blood pressure was probably due to dehydration.  It's pretty difficult for me to swallow liquids without nausea at this point, so it makes sense.  I'm gonna try sipping on some Gatorade today to see if it'll help me be a little less dehydrated.\n\nFull disclosure: before my stomach started misbehaving I vaporized marijuana recreationally, anywhere from .1g to .5g a day.  I used to partake rarely back when I was in California, primarily by using edibles.

Thanks in advance for looking this over, and I apologize for it being so long but I'm really trying to be thorough.  I'm a 27-year-old caucasian female from south FL, approximately 5'2\" and currently 140 lbs.  For the past month and a half I've been experiencing terrible, debilitating nausea and abdominal discomfort.  I also have NO appetite -- just the thought of eating makes me feel nauseous.  When I do try to eat I can only ever manage a few bites before I feel uncomfortably full.  <br>The situation escalated to the point where I lost about 8 lbs in a week and a half (went from 150-142) and I finally went to see a GI in mid-October. They performed an ultrasound of my gallbladder (clean!) and also did some blood work, which also came back clean.  The GI prescribed me 10mg dicyclomine to be taken 3 times a day, as well as a week long course of ciprofloxacin.  I responded well to the dicyclomine at first -- my first two days on the pills I felt almost normal.  But it started to have some diminishing returns pretty quickly, so I spoke with my GI and decided to take it four times a day.  Once again, I'm experiencing some diminishing returns and I am now taking dicyclomine five times a day.  He also recommended I take 20g omeprazole twice a day, which I have been doing for several weeks.  I saw him for a followup on Weds and explained I was still experiencing nausea and difficulty eating, so he's now added a probiotic (Align, taken I believe once daily?  I haven't started yet, I ordered the pills online and they should be arriving today) and he suggested taking a Tums before bedtime (which I have done for the last few days, using \"ultra strength\" Tums.)<br>Like I said, the medication seemed to work at first.  I went from 142 to 144-46, and I was starting to function almost normally.  I still couldn't eat a lot but the nausea seemed to be resolved by the medication.  After a week I had to increase the dosage but it still mostly resolved my nausea.  Things are looking kind of bleak lately though.  I took my morning dose of omeprazole and dicyclomine about two hours ago and I'm still feeling nauseous, although a bit better than I did this morning.  The nausea is bad enough right now that I don't feel like I could function comfortably outside of my apartment.  I'm also starting to lose weight again (which yay, I guess, but I really wanted to get there through proper diet and exercise, not because I can't eat food.)<br>Some more relevant information: I experienced a similar situation back in March/April where I felt nauseous and unable to eat.  This lasted about 3-4 weeks, and was not nearly as serious as the nausea I experience now.  I just stuck to a diet of simple chicken broth and saltines until my stomach settled, which it eventually did.  I didn't see a doctor for that.  I had also been losing weight intentionally prior to my stomach issues, approximately 25 lbs before these shenanigans began. Back in June I experienced SEVERE, sharp abdominal pain that lasted for about 4-5 days.  I saw the GI back then as well and he said it was likely a gallbladder attack from the weight loss and he gave me a prescription, but by that point I was actually getting better on my own and didn't end up taking the medication.  Eventually the pain went away completely and I was totally fine pretty much until October when this whole mess started.<br>Since this is a GI problem I should probably discuss my bowel movements.  Mostly it's been kind of inconsistent, probably because of how wildly my eating habits vary lately.  Some mornings I'll produce several large, soft BMs, other days it's almost nothing all day -- small, hard BMs.  Lately it's been almost nothing, I suspect because I'm having so much trouble eating.  But who knows?  Urine seems to be pretty normal, at least to me.  <br>The nausea is basically constant but I've only thrown up once this whole time back in October, and what I threw up was literally just a pill and water.  (There was nothing else in my system.)  I feel like if I pushed myself to eat more it would probably end up making me vomit, but I haven't really wanted to try that yet.  Also, the nausea seems to come in waves: it's always present, but sometimes it just gets SO MUCH WORSE before ebbing back to a lower level.  Aside from the nausea I get occasional stomach discomfort (not pain, more like a terrible gnawing sensation, it might just be hunger at this point honestly), fatigue (might be hunger or the dicyclomine), and rarely I get chills (again, probably hunger).  Also, when I went to the GI on Weds it took them a LONG time to get a blood pressure reading for me.  Multiple attempts on each arm, until finally the fifth time the nurse wrapped the sleeve around my forearm and managed to get a reading.  I don't recall what it was but the nurse didn't comment on it, so I'm assuming it was within normal range.  She said the difficulty getting a reading on my blood pressure was probably due to dehydration.  It's pretty difficult for me to swallow liquids without nausea at this point, so it makes sense.  I'm gonna try sipping on some Gatorade today to see if it'll help me be a little less dehydrated.<br>Full disclosure: before my stomach started misbehaving I vaporized marijuana recreationally, anywhere from .1g to .5g a day.  I used to partake rarely back when I was in California, primarily by using edibles.  I stopped for 6 months after moving from California to a fully illegal state and only resumed usage back in early August.

I was given 10mg IV morphine to start and 4mg thereafter. I was told by my ER doctor he couldn’t prescribe me pain meds because I already had my pain management prescription, but to take extra if the pain got too bad which of course it did and I ran out early. 3 days ago I was back in the ER for a lump on my neck directly on top of my VP shunt (a tube that goes from my brain to my abdomen and drains excess spinal fluid for a condition called Pseudotumor Cerebri). I needed surgery that day to replace the tube that broke. I have a 3 inch incision in the middle of my abdomen and a bigger one along my skull/neck. My surgeon prescribed enough oxycodone 20mg (my normal dosage per pain management) to last 2 days and told me I should be able to get my pain management doctor to release my refill a few days early due to my circumstances. I was refused and shocked because during my 3 years in pain management I’ve never asked for more pain meds because I finished them early. I’ve never been in this situation before where I needed a surprise surgery.

It lasted about an hour.<br>Two weeks later, I've been feeling low on energy, I have history of depression.  When I lay down to go to sleep, I keep feeling jolts in my chest that seem like heart flutters.  Then it feels like my BP drops, I get faint, sweaty palms, increased heart rate. Hyperventilating. I try to do breathing exercises to calm down.  I go into full panic mode.  I get very faint, confused, anxious, sense of impending doom as is my heart is going to stop.  I convince myself that it was just a panic attack like two weeks before.<br>After a couple hours, I finally manage to fall asleep.  I JOLT awake at 6 am after only a few hours asleep to what feels like another heart flutter (again, can't confirm it is a flutter it just feels that way). A few minutes later I managed to fall asleep again but I JOLT awake even harder straight to my and start hyperventilating, burst into tears from fear and tiredness and drive to the hospital.<br>At the hospital, I tell the same story.  The doc orders an EKG, a bunch of blood work, urine tox and a chest x-ray.  They come up empty.  I seem healthy, however, they didn't test for T3/T4.  Also, I did a bump of cocaine last weekend and that shows up in the UT.  So, they diagnose me with panic disorder and drug use.  Discharged.<br>Here's the thing, I don't feel like I have panic disorder.  I don't have any history of it.  This is a physical problem that's happening in my body and causing me to panic.  It happens intermittently but almost ALWAYS when I lay down to rest.  It happens in my sleep, or when I'm awake.<br>So tonight it happened again, and I'm sitting on the couch doing the best I can to recover from it, but now I have a fear of lying down.<br>I've researched my symptoms and it seems like it could be hyperthyroidism.  Heart flutters, faintness, lack of energy, anxiety.  It all adds up.<br>What do you think?<br><strong>Clinical Conversation</strong><br>Doctor Question: Did they do a TSH in the hospital?<br>Patient Response: I'm not sure if they did a TSH.", "<br><big><strong>Question and Answer to Evaluate</strong></big><br><strong>Question</strong> Based on this patient’s intermittent heart flutters, faintness, and episodes of intense anxiety at rest or during sleep, along with normal EKG and other basic evaluations, which of the following diagnoses is most likely?<br><strong>Options</strong><br>A.

I then got my vision rechecked by an optometrist who noticed nothing unusual beyond a discrepancy of vision loss between the two eyes; my suspicion that one of my eyes had become lazy was therefore thwarted (I guess, since he probably would have noticed that) and I got a new pair of glasses that would hopefully accommodate me.\n\nSince then, my right eye's ability to focus without strain had worsened and had been coupled by other concurrent issues.

This started out as what was thought to be some atypical migraine - severe pain behind the eye that would sometimes shoot down to the ear that simply would not go away. Occasional nausea but no symptoms aside from that. Day 4 she went to urgent care and received IM Zofran and 60mg IM Toradol. This helped greatly.....for about 18 hours. Day 7 she couldn’t take it anymore and went to the ER (the wait for the ER was because she was uninsured and open season for insurance for my company was literally in 8 days). So they do a CT scan. Everyone’s affect immediately changes, they begin doing q1min neuro checks, me being and RN myself my heart drops to the floor. The MD comes in and says the found what look to be some bleeding and they’re transferring her to a trauma hospital immediately... fast forward to the trauma facility the MRI shows a spontaneous subdural hematoma. The kicker is they simply cannot find the cause. No clots, no anuersym, no vascular abnormalities, no trauma, no medications taken regularly, no medical history whatsoever aside from ovarian cysts. So neurosurgery and hematology run every lab in the book. EVERYTHING is normal (we’re still waiting on some specific clotting factor tests). Everyones stumped. The bleed doesn’t even completely correspond to where her pain is. Shes in excruciating pain that is responding somewhat to Fioricet and IV Decadron Q8H. They monitor the bleed with repeat CTs and it’s stable. So fast forward 4 days later here we are home. With no answers. Follow ups with neurosurgeon and hematology.She is in complete agonizing pain.

I have been having chest pains for a few years now. They are really intense and get worse if I take a deep breath. Normally it just hurts right under my breast on the left side. It’s like a burning sharp pain. Sometimes I barely notice it, sometimes it’s insanely painful. When it’s at its worst it effects other parts of my body. My stomach also hurts, mostly next to my left hip bone. my neck, jaw, and shoulder become stiff and hurt, and then I can’t feel my left arm and it’s in pain. Like it’s dead weight and tingly but it still hurts. \n\nSo I went to see a doctor about it, I haven’t been since I was a kid so this was a new doctor. I told him my problem and he did a blood test, which came back normal. So he said it’s probably nothing and that I’m probably fine. I hate going to the doctor so I was like “cool.” And left. A couple months ago I had a really bad one, and my BF wanted me to go to the ER but I refused. So the next day he convinced me to go to instacare. They did chest X-rays and an ekg. The Dr. there said that my left lung looked strange to her. She said that some people would look over it and give me a call, but no one ever did. She also told me to check in with me GP, so I did. This time he didn’t do any tests, just said the instacare Dr. was over reacting and that even though he didn’t see the X-ray, that I was fine. So again, I took him at his word\n\nBut I got the flu a few weeks ago, and went to instacare. Everything was normal but they left the heart monitor thing they put on your finger on the whole visit. Which I didn’t really think anything of, I thought they just forgot about it. \nBut at the end the Dr. looked at the thing on my finger and said “the whole time you have been here your heart rate has risen and fallen really fast.” And she wanted me to do another ekg, and said my heart rate was really fast during it. She asked me if I was pregnant, which I said no. She said that I might have a blood clot in my lung. She wanted me to do a pregnancy test but I got really freaked out about the whole thing and told her I would take one at home. She told me to call her immediately if it was positive. I did But it was negative, so I just forgot about it. \n\nAlso I’m unsure if it’s related, but my left arm has become super weak. I can’t lift it above my chest without losing feeling and it hurts constantly.\n\nAnyways, I don’t want to pay to go back to my doctor again just for him to tell me I’m over reacting.

This time he didn’t do any tests, just said the instacare Dr. was over reacting and that even though he didn’t see the X-ray, that I was fine. So again, I took him at his word<br>But I got the flu a few weeks ago, and went to instacare. Everything was normal but they left the heart monitor thing they put on your finger on the whole visit. Which I didn’t really think anything of, I thought they just forgot about it. <br>But at the end the Dr. looked at the thing on my finger and said “the whole time you have been here your heart rate has risen and fallen really fast.” And she wanted me to do another ekg, and said my heart rate was really fast during it. She asked me if I was pregnant, which I said no. She said that I might have a blood clot in my lung. She wanted me to do a pregnancy test but I got really freaked out about the whole thing and told her I would take one at home. She told me to call her immediately if it was positive. I did But it was negative, so I just forgot about it. <br>Also I’m unsure if it’s related, but my left arm has become super weak. I can’t lift it above my chest without losing feeling and it hurts constantly.<br>Anyways, I don’t want to pay to go back to my doctor again just for him to tell me I’m over reacting. I’ve been three times, two were for this problem and every time I go he says I’m fine or tries to put me on anti depressants I don’t want.

For most people I know, this is comfortable, for me it's torture.  <br>My window is always open, my table fan is always on, I can't wear anything else other than t-shirts and shorts.  <br>It's not that I feel \"oh, wow, it's hot huh...\", it's more like I'm always on the verge of a heatstroke. But the thermometer always show 37ºC (98.6ºF)  <br>I remember when it was winter here around mid july, I had to leave 5 in the morning, it was 5ºC (41ºF), my hair was wet, really windy, and all I had on was a shirt, t-shirt and jeans, the shirt which I had to remove later.  <br>When it's a bit cold (between 10ºC and 15ºC) I get really hyped up and can get a lot of stuff done. When it's hot (anything above 20ºC) I feel extremely sluggish, and when it hits 30ºC, I honestly can't do anything, moving my body becomes a hassle and simple things (like taking a shower or going grocery shopping) makes me either have to rest every 5 minutes or makes me collapse.  <br>I don't seem to sweat as much as expected from the heat I seem to feel.  <br>My weight also hasn't changed in the last 7 years, doesn't matter how much of a lazy couch potato or healthy crossfitter I try to be.<br>*ps. I am sorry if this only seemed like a rant, but I don't know how to explain exactly how I feel.*  <br>*pss.

With that out of the way, six days ago I went to the mall to see Christmas decorations and to look for presents for my younger cousins. Now, I don’t go out much, and I also have a phobia of germs. As a result, for the past four to five years, I usually only get sick once a year, if at all. The reason I’m bringing this up is because I thought it worth noting that perhaps my immune system isn’t very strong. I don’t know whether or not this is relevant, but I thought it worth noting based on the title of the thread. Anyways, since my cousins are eight and five, I went into a lot of toy stores. I bring this up because kids are nasty. By that, I mean they are always exposed to illnesses and don’t wash their hands before touching things. I don’t hate kids! It’s worth noting  I hadn’t yet gotten my flu shot, but I wasn’t all that concerned, as when I’m in public, I keep my hands away from my face when they aren’t clean, always wash my hands before I eat anything, and even open doors with my shirt covering my hand.\nI left after a few hours. The following evening, my throat was ever so slightly sore. That’s a big red flag for me, but I went to bed and hoped it wasn’t going to be brutal. I woke up the next morning with a hellish pain in my throat. It hurt to swallow. It hurt to drink. It hurt. Period. My ears were popping and aching as well. I went to assess the damage and noticed white blotches behind my uvula, which seemed off. After a few hours and two Ibuprofen, the throat pain was pretty minimal, though my ears were still popping. Later that evening, I developed a cough, which only got worse as the night went on. All this combined with me coughing up phlegm, I decided to go to a walk in clinic the following day if I remained this way. I woke up in the morning, and I actually felt quite a bit better. I was still coughing up phlegm, and my cough was now a constant symptom, but my throat felt pretty okay. Nonetheless, I went to the clinic that evening. I explained my symptoms, and requested a strep test, which they obliged. The test came back negative, and the doctor said apart from my ears having some fluid in them, it seemed like a normal viral infection. Since I didn’t have a fever, headaches or chills, I also got my flu shot while I was there. Truthfully, I still wasn’t entirely convinced by the strep test, as I recall having strep when I was younger that only showed itself in a bacteria culture a few days after I went to the doctor and had the quick strep test come back negative. I figured, as a walk in clinic, they might not have been prepared to do a bacteria culture, so I didn’t say anything. I was told to come back if my ears got worse, and that was that. The next day (yesterday), I woke up and I was worse. My throat hurt again, I was awfully congested, my ears ached, and my cough was even more aggressive. I took Ibuprofen and it didn’t help. I ended up canceling my plans, went back to sleep for a few hours, and when I woke up, I felt considerably better. Not good, but better. My symptoms were just less aggressive. I wasn’t completely alarmed by this because I figured maybe it would just get worse before it gets better. Went about my day, and went to bed. Finally, we’re at today. I wake up, and my throat felt even worse. My nose was stuffed, I was congested, my ears hurt, and I had a splitting headache. I took some Ibuprofen and went back to sleep. That was a few hours ago, and as I write this, I’ve still got that splitting headache. My ears still ache. My throat doesn’t hurt as bad, but it still hurts.

On top of that, he told us to only call him if the resident got a fever.<br>So my shift started, I discussed the situation with a fellow colleague who was equally as angry as I was (the resident was still extremely upset, hitting everything around him, quick surface breathing, we could easily see he was in pain. Family had arrived at that point and said the same. Once family says there;s something bad going on, it's in our best interest to absolutely believe them). We called the doctor again, after a few hours an assistant called back telling us the doctor prescribed **oxycodon** (5mg... but it's something to start with). He also allowed us to **decrease the tube feedings**; still the same speed, just 50% water 50% peptisorb. <br>Later in the afternoon and evening he slept, slept and slept. He was calm, I guess. The whole day after him being admitted to hospital, there weren't any feces around his mouth or in his tube. Colleagues have pointed out that they would've recognized the smell of fecal vomiting, and because his feces are so thin, it could've been something else. But then again, the man takes in nothing but white/yellow peptisorb. The colour of the liquid could potentionally point to **nexium** (? he does take this but has never had this color show up) or **old blood**, which is still a massive problem. We weren't able to send him back to the ER since there was nothing accute going on anymore. The doctor didn't want to send him in again because he cannot say what's wrong... <br>**Extra information that I had missed:** He wasn't being tube fed the first few hours in hospital and seemed to calm down because of that, hence the change in his feeding pattern, yet he was still angry. <br>In his medical history this has happened before, nothing was ever done but it always cleared up by itself after different tube feeding or antibiotics. <br>He also has a **hernia diagfragmatica**, **reflux oesophagus** and when he was a young boy he had **stomach bleeding.**<br>**Thank you all for the comments and sweet words!

{"goodness": true, "thread_id": "t_hpttplp-0", "patient_info": "My significant other's health has sharply deteriorated and after months we have no idea what it is.\n\nHello. My (24F) boyfriend, Paul (29M), and I are fairly active. We go on road trips every year with our main stops being prime hiking spots. Paul is 5'7'' and 230 pounds. Due to his southeast asian/pacific genetics, his entire family is on the heavier side, but Paul is just as active as I am and eats well.\n\nRecently, we have gone long distance. Paul returned to live with his parents due to the pandemic while I stayed where I was. I visited him in June 2021. At this point, Paul had few symptoms, but some new minor health issues. We went hiking around Lake Tahoe and Paul was a little more out of breath than usual. He hasn't needed to use his inhaler since he was a kid, and he had to use it on this trip. We attributed this to recent wildfires in the area and poor air quality.\n\nHowever, Paul's health continued to sharply deteriorate. We went to Edinburgh, Scotland, in July. While hiking Arthur's Seat, Paul had to use his inhaler so many times he emptied it out. He could not get it refilled as we were out of the country. Until the end of the trip, Paul's breathing became more and more labored and he developed a persistent cough.\n\nI did not visit Paul August-November 2021. We spoke on the phone and Skyped regularly. During this time, Paul would sometimes leave the call or mute for a few minutes. He'd come back and apologize, saying he'd had to cough pretty violently and didn't want me to hear. I was concerned. I overheard one wracking, moaning coughing session and knew it was not just asthma or an irritated throat. By October 2021, the air quality in his area had greatly improved.\n\nI persuaded Paul to visit his general practitioner. His GP dismissed all of his concerns and cited Paul's being fat and asthmatic as the source of his issues, and that the issues would disappear with rest and exercise. I had to fight doctors for years to get them to take my chronic pelvic pain seriously, and was finally diagnosed with an ovarian cyst that was 8mm long and about to burst, so I have experience with self advocacy in the medical space. I helped Paul see new doctors.\n\nIn mid-October 2021, Paul developed abdominal edema. Paul's feet, legs, and lower stomach were swelling up like crazy. He gained 40 pounds. He could barely move at all, even to go to the bathroom. He couldn't sleep lying down without suffocating, which only worsened his exhaustion. He went to the doctor again and was prescribed diuretics. The diuretics helped with the swelling and extra weight and within 2 weeks he was back to his regular weight, but the coughing and weakness persisted.\n\nAbout a month after regularly taking diuretics (November), Paul started feeling intense nausea on a weekly basis. This nausea would prompt coughing fits. Paul couldn't eat or focus while nauseated. Our calls became more and more infrequent as Paul's nausea and headaches grew. He told me sometimes the nausea would get so bad that he would vomit. There were no patterns to the vomiting--it didn't happen at a certain time of day or after meals. Sometimes it was foamy. He got a CT scan to look at his gall bladder and all results were within normal ranges. Blood tests, including labs for liver function, all came back normal. His doctor referred him to a gastroenterologist for more testing, but due to increases in COVID-19 cases, they haven't even processed his file, let alone scheduled appointments, which would be months out. A nurse anticipated he wouldn't be able to go in until February 2022, but at his rate of decline, this has me concerned for his mental wellbeing and life quality.\n\nThis week, in late December 2021, I visited him and his family for Christmas. I had heard from Paul about his issues and was following closely with his medical updates, but seeing it firsthand was another thing altogether. I have never seen human suffering and sickness like this up close or cared for another human being in such an intimate way.\n\nEvery single day, he has intense coughing fits and bouts of nausea where he makes vocalizations and gags, usually every few hours. At least once a day, these coughing fits are so bad that he spends 5-30 minutes vomiting in the sink. The vomiting has increased drastically. After this, the nausea alleviates, but Paul feels exhausted and has migraines. He barely eats. He barely sleeps.\n\nToday, he had three different nausea/coughing bouts that induced vomiting. One developed rapidly and he threw up in a restaurant bathroom. The last one, which just happened this evening as of writing this post, also caught him by surprise, and he vomited in the kitchen sink. The vomiting was so physically taxing that his nose bled profusely and he lost control of his bowels and peed himself. He was not strong enough to make it down the hall to the bathroom. Eventually, I assisted him into the shower. I am writing this before bed, and he is still coughing, and has a migraine. He hasn't gotten up from where he sat after taking the shower.\n\nI would appreciate any medical advice about what might be causing what Paul is going through, as well as tips for how to navigate the medical system to ensure this gets treated in the best way possible. I would like to reiterate that while neither of us are marathon running body builders, Paul (before all of this) was physically active and monitored his eating habits. He was also mentally active and had returned to school to pursue a degree in a new field. We both have families that are reasonably well off and are good support systems.\n\nPaul is one tough puppy, and reassures me that it \"isn't so bad,\" but after seeing it firsthand, I know this is not something that can continue the way it is. I am extremely worried, and caring for him is beginning to wear on me mentally. Sometimes I feel sympathy nausea when I hear the noises he makes in the bathroom.\n\nPlease help in any way possible. I appreciate any and every tip, and can provide additional information if needed. Thank you very much.\n\nUPDATE 12/26:\n\nWe went to the ER at 4 AM right after Christmas. Luckily, it was almost completely empty. I was not allowed to go back with him, so for the entire five hours I was sitting in the waiting room, I was only ever accompanied by one or two other people at a time.\n\nPaul's shortness of breath, fatigue, and wracking coughs got him seen quickly. He texted me updates as things progressed. He got every test I wrote down from these comments--BNP test, pulmonary work, chest x rays, GI work. An echocardigram is scheduled for next week.\n\nThey found out right away that Paul's BNP results were seven times higher than usual. They said this was indicative of heart failure. They also tested Paul for COVID 19. He tested negative, but did test indicating he had some kind of viral illness.\n\nPaul's doctor concluded that he was suffering from chronic RSV that was made worse by poor genetics, asthma, and obesity. Paul did confirm he had what felt like a respiratory illness in Scotland in June, then after going to a wedding in October, then this week when he got severely ill and we found out his mother had a cold.\n\nThere is no cure for RSV, but a vaccine has reached human trials. The only things Paul can do to alleviate his own suffering and avoid a heart attack is to make significant lifestyle changes and live like an immunocompromised person. I believe in his ability to achieve the former, but the latter is more difficult because of his emotionally overattached mother who brings the entire extended family out for lunches, movie nights, shopping, etc. several times a week. I'm concerned she won't take it seriously or will be in denial to avoid feeling responsible and will therefore continue to expose Paul to colds that could kill him.\n\nPaul is currently resting. He was given medication for his nausea and a new inhaler. He is doing better but still coughing. We have already started on his new food regimen. I am hoping for the best, but the pandemic has proved that people rarely take precautions for others' goodwill. Thank you for all your support.

By October 2021, the air quality in his area had greatly improved.\n\nI persuaded Paul to visit his general practitioner. His GP dismissed all of his concerns and cited Paul's being fat and asthmatic as the source of his issues, and that the issues would disappear with rest and exercise. I had to fight doctors for years to get them to take my chronic pelvic pain seriously, and was finally diagnosed with an ovarian cyst that was 8mm long and about to burst, so I have experience with self advocacy in the medical space. I helped Paul see new doctors.\n\nIn mid-October 2021, Paul developed abdominal edema. Paul's feet, legs, and lower stomach were swelling up like crazy. He gained 40 pounds. He could barely move at all, even to go to the bathroom. He couldn't sleep lying down without suffocating, which only worsened his exhaustion. He went to the doctor again and was prescribed diuretics. The diuretics helped with the swelling and extra weight and within 2 weeks he was back to his regular weight, but the coughing and weakness persisted.\n\nAbout a month after regularly taking diuretics (November), Paul started feeling intense nausea on a weekly basis. This nausea would prompt coughing fits. Paul couldn't eat or focus while nauseated. Our calls became more and more infrequent as Paul's nausea and headaches grew. He told me sometimes the nausea would get so bad that he would vomit. There were no patterns to the vomiting--it didn't happen at a certain time of day or after meals. Sometimes it was foamy. He got a CT scan to look at his gall bladder and all results were within normal ranges. Blood tests, including labs for liver function, all came back normal. His doctor referred him to a gastroenterologist for more testing, but due to increases in COVID-19 cases, they haven't even processed his file, let alone scheduled appointments, which would be months out. A nurse anticipated he wouldn't be able to go in until February 2022, but at his rate of decline, this has me concerned for his mental wellbeing and life quality.\n\nThis week, in late December 2021, I visited him and his family for Christmas. I had heard from Paul about his issues and was following closely with his medical updates, but seeing it firsthand was another thing altogether. I have never seen human suffering and sickness like this up close or cared for another human being in such an intimate way.\n\nEvery single day, he has intense coughing fits and bouts of nausea where he makes vocalizations and gags, usually every few hours. At least once a day, these coughing fits are so bad that he spends 5-30 minutes vomiting in the sink. The vomiting has increased drastically. After this, the nausea alleviates, but Paul feels exhausted and has migraines. He barely eats. He barely sleeps.\n\nToday, he had three different nausea/coughing bouts that induced vomiting. One developed rapidly and he threw up in a restaurant bathroom. The last one, which just happened this evening as of writing this post, also caught him by surprise, and he vomited in the kitchen sink. The vomiting was so physically taxing that his nose bled profusely and he lost control of his bowels and peed himself. He was not strong enough to make it down the hall to the bathroom. Eventually, I assisted him into the shower. I am writing this before bed, and he is still coughing, and has a migraine. He hasn't gotten up from where he sat after taking the shower.\n\nI would appreciate any medical advice about what might be causing what Paul is going through, as well as tips for how to navigate the medical system to ensure this gets treated in the best way possible. I would like to reiterate that while neither of us are marathon running body builders, Paul (before all of this) was physically active and monitored his eating habits. He was also mentally active and had returned to school to pursue a degree in a new field. We both have families that are reasonably well off and are good support systems.\n\nPaul is one tough puppy, and reassures me that it \"isn't so bad,\" but after seeing it firsthand, I know this is not something that can continue the way it is. I am extremely worried, and caring for him is beginning to wear on me mentally. Sometimes I feel sympathy nausea when I hear the noises he makes in the bathroom.\n\nPlease help in any way possible. I appreciate any and every tip, and can provide additional information if needed. Thank you very much.\n\nUPDATE 12/26:\n\nWe went to the ER at 4 AM right after Christmas. Luckily, it was almost completely empty. I was not allowed to go back with him, so for the entire five hours I was sitting in the waiting room, I was only ever accompanied by one or two other people at a time.\n\nPaul's shortness of breath, fatigue, and wracking coughs got him seen quickly. He texted me updates as things progressed. He got every test I wrote down from these comments--BNP test, pulmonary work, chest x rays, GI work. An echocardigram is scheduled for next week.\n\nThey found out right away that Paul's BNP results were seven times higher than usual. They said this was indicative of heart failure. They also tested Paul for COVID 19. He tested negative, but did test indicating he had some kind of viral illness.\n\nPaul's doctor concluded that he was suffering from chronic RSV that was made worse by poor genetics, asthma, and obesity. Paul did confirm he had what felt like a respiratory illness in Scotland in June, then after going to a wedding in October, then this week when he got severely ill and we found out his mother had a cold.\n\nThere is no cure for RSV, but a vaccine has reached human trials. The only things Paul can do to alleviate his own suffering and avoid a heart attack is to make significant lifestyle changes and live like an immunocompromised person. I believe in his ability to achieve the former, but the latter is more difficult because of his emotionally overattached mother who brings the entire extended family out for lunches, movie nights, shopping, etc. several times a week. I'm concerned she won't take it seriously or will be in denial to avoid feeling responsible and will therefore continue to expose Paul to colds that could kill him.\n\nPaul is currently resting. He was given medication for his nausea and a new inhaler. He is doing better but still coughing. We have already started on his new food regimen. I am hoping for the best, but the pandemic has proved that people rarely take precautions for others' goodwill. Thank you for all your support.

Then, last year in November it came back and it's lasted all the way to now, end of April. I think it's slowly getting worse but I can't really tell. It takes me 40 minutes to finish a meal that takes a normal person maybe 7 minutes to finish.<br>Mostly I feel that the right side of my throat is very tight and food only goes through the left side. This in turn generated a fear of choking so I'm chewing my food for ever. Even liquids I can feel them distinctly go through the left side but without issues. Food was never stuck in my throat, never made me cough or went the wrong way. Just feels like a tighter passage.<br>Now, I did see multiple doctors and now I'm seeing a hospital doctor. In all they performed 1 nasal endoscopy, 1 full mouth endoscopy all the way to the duodenum, 3 ultrasounds and 1 MRI of the head &amp; neck. They found nothing except irritation in my throat which they thought was caused by gastric acid. It's now two months I've been taking Dexilant 60mg with no improvement, maybe the contrary. I also changed my diet - not that I ever ate fast food - but I added some Apple Cider Vinegar before meals, Kefir after meals, frying eggs with coconut oil, etc.  Even so, it's really hard to maintain my weight and not go insane with this issue. It's debilitating to chew for so long and most of all, it doesn't seem the doctors know what is causing this... except that it's not anything serious! Because of this, and because I'm in Canada, they scheduled a barium swallow test in 6 months!!!
