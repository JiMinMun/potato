True,t_cgqe7u2-0,"Numbness

Hi,
I am a 16 year old girl and I know it is common for people's limbs to 'fall asleep' or 'go numb' after awhile. However, recently it has been happening to me a lot and a lot faster than normal. Also, my feet, arm, whatever will fall asleep in positions that they usually are fine in and faster than normal. 
I recently got my wisdom teeth out and I am anemic.
Is this because of my anemia, a reaction to the anesthesia (it was my first time going under),should I make an appointment with my actual doctor, or is it nothing to be worried about?
Thanks!","Doctor Question: Are you on iron supplements, and if so have you been for long?
Patient Response: I've known I'm anemic for about a year and I'm on over the counter Iron supplements on an as-needed basis.

Doctor Question: If you were only recently diagnosed/treated for anemia then give it some time, but if it's been a while you might wanna get it retested to see if you're responding to the supplements.

It's starting to become incredibly frustrating that I can't just be still or hold something without it shaking a bit.

True,t_dqibdlq-0,"Was I misdiagnosed with a Tic?

When I was 17, I started exhibiting an eye twitch. Was referred to neurologist and diagnosed with a “Tic.” I was prescribed Atarax 10mg. The medication worked and I stopped taking it once I ran out of the first bottle. 

I couldn’t feel the actual “ticking,” it didn’t feel like an “itch” or an impulse commonly attributed with Tics. I had no idea when it would happen and people would just be like “woah your eye just spazzed out.” At the time, I was under a lot of stress and in a school play so I was busy a lot and not sleeping enough and had social anxiety. 

Since then, no one has pointed out the twitch and my parents claim they haven’t seen me do it in years. It was pretty sporadic and disappeared just the same.

My parents described the twitch as a repetitive blinking but it would only happen in one eye. I’ve never seen nor felt myself do it. They said it would come out towards the end of the day or if I was talking about something that made me angry or excited. 

I’m just curious as to what it was, I’ve read a lot on Tourette’s Syndrome and have watched many documentaries on tics and I feel like my symptoms were not the same thing. 

Should also mention that the neurologist ordered an MRI at the time and the results were normal.

For a few days my chest has felt sore on the right side when I breathe in too deep. It's not too bad, but I'm not a doctor so I don't really know if I should be concerned.

2. I just got home from a week in the mountains. While I was there, I had a little trouble breathing due to the high altitude and lack of oxygen and probably had ""mountain sickness"" or whatever it's called. I feel fine now that I'm back home, except for the chest pain and cold that started almost as soon as I landed.

False,t_clpdmra-0,"How many abortions do I need before doctors will talk about sterilization/hysterectomy? Will 3 abortions be enough? 5 abortions? 10 abortions?

I wanted a doctor's perspective. I am pursuing sterilization at age 22. This is as informed as it gets (I've been researching options for at least 10 years--that's how awful pregnancy and childbirth sounds). In fact the best option (from research that included medical journal articles as well as medical sites and doctor sites) would be hysterectomy because of hormonal issues tied to my menstrual period. It means most birth controls have unacceptable side effects and progesterin only ones are worse. Condoms of any sort are unbearably painful, I also have a nickel allergy so I can't use non hormonal iud. I keep taken off of every pill and the shot for side effects. I never felt better as I did on Lupron but I can't even have that because I had it for a year long. 

But sterilization would reduce my bad days (many little-to-no functioning days) from the entire month to 10 days a month (because wouldn't need birth control). I mean cutting the tubes or even taking part of them out. I can't do Essure because of the nickel allergy.


But doctors won't even talk about either. And they won't talk about it because then I can't have babies. I'm never having babies anyway and if I do they'll be adopted. I've stated this clearly. I've been to many of them since all that I saw here in this city won't even discuss it with me. If they were concerned about medical risks that would be one thing. But no, its because obviously I'm a woman so I want babies."" and obviously I'm too young and irresponsible to make that call, because all women are until they have a baby (and even after they aren't fit to make that call).

<strong>Patient Info</strong>How many abortions do I need before doctors will talk about sterilization/hysterectomy? Will 3 abortions be enough? 5 abortions? 10 abortions?

I wanted a doctor's perspective. I am pursuing sterilization at age 22. This is as informed as it gets (I've been researching options for at least 10 years--that's how awful pregnancy and childbirth sounds). In fact the best option (from research that included medical journal articles as well as medical sites and doctor sites) would be hysterectomy because of hormonal issues tied to my menstrual period. It means most birth controls have unacceptable side effects and progesterin only ones are worse. Condoms of any sort are unbearably painful, I also have a nickel allergy so I can't use non hormonal iud. I keep taken off of every pill and the shot for side effects. I never felt better as I did on Lupron but I can't even have that because I had it for a year long. 

But sterilization would reduce my bad days (many little-to-no functioning days) from the entire month to 10 days a month (because wouldn't need birth control). I mean cutting the tubes or even taking part of them out. I can't do Essure because of the nickel allergy.


But doctors won't even talk about either. And they won't talk about it because then I can't have babies. I'm never having babies anyway and if I do they'll be adopted. I've stated this clearly. I've been to many of them since all that I saw here in this city won't even discuss it with me. If they were concerned about medical risks that would be one thing. But no, its because obviously I'm a woman so I want babies."" and obviously I'm too young and irresponsible to make that call, because all women are until they have a baby (and even after they aren't fit to make that call).

Ok, so down a week on the celexa and nothing has seemingly changed..not feeling any better but not really surprising...What is surprsing, blood clots....It has been my main concern for about 4 days now and i can't seem to get over it like most stuff..I went to the er after a dull chest pain in my muscle after a day and it would hurt when i would deep breath...So of course right of bat they do an ekg...wait around doctor comes and said te ekg looked good, now he wants blood work cause of my family history of heart disease..blood work down, and then they come out and tell me i need a chest x-ray...at this point im really losing it...wait some more and they come and get me and say my d-dimer test was high and i need a CT Scan now...so we get all hooked up and back we go..my d dimer came back at around 308..not terrible but he said with my history he wanted it check for peace of mind...so we go back ct scan 5 minutes and the waiting game begins...2 hours later the doctor comes in and says, no clots everything came back fine and your free to go. No reason behind my d dimer being high nothing...so my anxiety subsides for a night til dr google comes out in me of course. Now i'm experiencing what i feel is leg pain, and chest pain, but not when i deep breath...just looking if anyone has gone through anything similar? Would they be able to tell if i had any clots off of the blood work and the ct scan anywhere in my body? Do i have anything to stress about?
