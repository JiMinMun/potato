Also, my feet, arm, whatever will fall asleep in positions that they usually are fine in and faster than normal. <br>I recently got my wisdom teeth out and I am anemic.<br>Is this because of my anemia, a reaction to the anesthesia (it was my first time going under),should I make an appointment with my actual doctor, or is it nothing to be worried about?<br>Thanks!<br><strong>Clinical Conversation</strong><br>Doctor Question: Are you on iron supplements, and if so have you been for long?<br>Patient Response: I've known I'm anemic for about a year and I'm on over the counter Iron supplements on an as-needed basis.<br>Doctor Question: If you were only recently diagnosed/treated for anemia then give it some time, but if it's been a while you might wanna get it retested to see if you're responding to the supplements.<br>Patient Response: I've known I'm anemic for about a year and I'm on over the counter Iron supplements on an as-needed basis.<br><br><big><strong>Question and Answer to Evaluate</strong></big><br><strong>Question</strong> Which factor most likely explains the patient's recurrent limb numbness, given her recent experience and history of anemia?<br><strong>Options</strong><br>A.

{"id": "t_dbuj8ae-0", "displayed_text": "<big><strong>Context</strong></big><br><strong>Patient Info</strong><br>30yo m, mild chest pain, several possible causes<br>For a few days my chest has felt sore on the right side when I breathe in too deep. It's not too bad, but I'm not a doctor so I don't really know if I should be concerned.<br>There are two main things that could be causing it:<br>1. Most obvious, I just came down with a cold. I haven't been coughing much yet, but my throat has been sore and I'm a little more sneezy than usual.<br><br>2. I just got home from a week in the mountains. While I was there, I had a little trouble breathing due to the high altitude and lack of oxygen and probably had \"mountain sickness\" or whatever it's called. I feel fine now that I'm back home, except for the chest pain and cold that started almost as soon as I landed.<br>Could it be related to either or both of those? When should I be concerned enough to see a doctor?<br>Thanks!<br><strong>Clinical Conversation</strong><br>Doctor Question: How long was the flight?<br>Patient Response: The flight home was about 2 hours or so.<br>Doctor Question: Do you have any calf pain or swelling?<br>Patient Response: I don't have any pain or swelling in my legs.<br>Doctor Question: Any Shortness of breath?<br>Patient Response: None<br>Doctor Question: Do you know how to check your pulse, if so check it and see if it's elevated.<br>Patient Response: I checked my heart rate and it seems normal as far as I can tell, 84 bpm.

{"id": "t_dqibdlq-0", "displayed_text": "<big><strong>Context</strong></big><br><strong>Patient Info</strong><br>Was I misdiagnosed with a Tic?<br>When I was 17, I started exhibiting an eye twitch. Was referred to neurologist and diagnosed with a \u201cTic.\u201d I was prescribed Atarax 10mg. The medication worked and I stopped taking it once I ran out of the first bottle. <br>I couldn\u2019t feel the actual \u201cticking,\u201d it didn\u2019t feel like an \u201citch\u201d or an impulse commonly attributed with Tics. I had no idea when it would happen and people would just be like \u201cwoah your eye just spazzed out.\u201d At the time, I was under a lot of stress and in a school play so I was busy a lot and not sleeping enough and had social anxiety. <br>Since then, no one has pointed out the twitch and my parents claim they haven\u2019t seen me do it in years. It was pretty sporadic and disappeared just the same.<br>My parents described the twitch as a repetitive blinking but it would only happen in one eye. I\u2019ve never seen nor felt myself do it. They said it would come out towards the end of the day or if I was talking about something that made me angry or excited. <br>I\u2019m just curious as to what it was, I\u2019ve read a lot on Tourette\u2019s Syndrome and have watched many documentaries on tics and I feel like my symptoms were not the same thing. <br>Should also mention that the neurologist ordered an MRI at the time and the results were normal. <br>Edit: The tic lasted maybe 2 or 3 months. I\u2019m female, 5\u201d8 half Filipino / half Caucasian. <br>Thanks !<br><strong>Clinical Conversation</strong><br>Doctor Question: What do you think your diagnosis should have been?<br>Patient Response: I don\u2019t know, I just figured it has to be neurological, maybe related to something messed up in my Autonomic Nervous System? It was so random. I never felt my eye twitch, I\u2019ve heard of people twitching prior to a seizure, that\u2019s what I thought would be going on. Maybe something with my potassium / sodium ion pumps?<br><br><big><strong>Question and Answer to Evaluate</strong></big><br><strong>Question</strong> Which explanation best accounts for the patient\u2019s eye twitch that resolved spontaneously?<br><strong>Options</strong><br>A. An early manifestation of partial seizures<br>B. A metabolic imbalance related to sodium/potassium pumps<br>C. A stress-induced tic that resolved once stress levels decreased<br>D. An early sign of Tourette\u2019s syndrome<br><strong>Answer</strong> C<br>", "label_annotations": {"Q1": {"No": "2"}, "Q2": {"Yes": "1"}}, "span_annotations": {}, "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 3s "}}
