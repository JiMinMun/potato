Thank you in advance for any help with this!

Okay, so my boyfriend came home last week sick with diarrhea, nausea, cramps, fever, aches, and chills. We chalked it up to the stomach flu. However, now I have yellow diarrhea (he said he did, too), stomach cramps, and extreme fatigue. We both have not been able to eat much (yesterday I had a small bowl of pudding and half a sandwich). I have not had fever, chills, or aches. However, this has been going on for about 5 days now and I'm not exactly sure if what we got was actually Gastroenteritis.  

Any advice would be wonderful. If this doesn't go away by Wednesday I need to see a Dr., but I'd like to know how to treat it now."	"Doctor Question: Did you two eat at a restaurant together recently?

Hi there. I am a 17yo female - 5'3"", 145~lb, Scotland.

My last period lasted 6 days - started the 6th of Feb and ended on the 12th.
I had sex on the 2nd of Feb, and the 14th - both times using a condom. 
My period started again on the 19th - but very painful, and it varies from almost black blood to bright red blood, though it is quite light. 

I'm already getting a blood test for anaemia [due to vegetarianism], but I'm not sure if this is related or not - though I have had very irregular periods in the past.

**UPDATE:** Had a blood test - my blood count is 120, so I am almost anaemic. I've been prescribed iron tablets. The doctor said it was very common for my periods to go a bit crazy at this age - but if it lasts any longer, then he can offer me 'a way to make it stop'.

True	t_cg6uht7-0	"Sleep Paralysis, please confirm not a stroke

I had an experience with what I am mostly certain was sleep paralysis this morning.  I had just fallen asleep, was dreaming, and noticed (in dream) my cheek was numb.  I then awoke, found that that half of my body was numb, I was incapable of movement, and that I was having difficulty breathing.  

It passed fairly quickly.  I am still symmetrical, and I've lately been having trouble with what wikipedia calls hypnic jerk, so I figure its just indicative of increasing stress and increasing fuckery of my sleep hormones.  

I am 21, female, and largely healthy, so I don't see any reason this should be a real problem but it was still terrifying so if somebody could just say ""yeah it was just sleep paralysis"" that would be great.

True	t_cgm1ytc-0	"Getting extremely dizzy while working out

Hey there. I'm a male, 20 years old, 188 cm tall (6.16 feet), I must weigh around 90 kg (198 lbs) and I recently started working out again at the gym after a 5 year hiatus of neglecting any long term physical activities in my life.  
I have a problem that is making working out at the gym very unpleasant. When I'm midway throughout my workout routine I start getting extremely nauseous whenever I get on my feet after doing some sets on a machine or after doing some crunches. One time it got so bad that I had to run to the bathrooms and puked right then, right there. I tried eating less before working out, it made no difference. Eating a good meal 2 hrs before exercising did not help either. I thought it was dehydration but drinking lots of water only made me feel even worse.  
The workouts I'm doing are not that demanding at all, since I'm still trying to get my body used to working out again. Is it supposed to make me feel like shit? Clearly I'm doing something wrong here...
The symptoms are: dizziness, a loud buzzing in my ears, distorted vision, sometimes I get stomach aches.  
I'd be really grateful if somebody could help me."	"Doctor Question: How long does the dizziness last during each episode?
Patient Response: The dizziness lasts for an estimate of 2 to 3 minutes. The one time it got more severe to the brink of vomiting, it must have lasted for about 7 minutes. I had a hard time understanding what was going on around me and interpreting the words I was hearing. Putting together sentences was also kind of hard.

Doctor Question: Is there any particular exercises that make the dizziness more severe?
Patient Response: The exercise I almost had trouble with was the Lower Back Extension, with the Roman Chair. Sometimes after doing crunches, I had to wait about 2 minutes before getting up and even then I'd feel a little bit weird.

Doctor Question: Immediately after having a dizzy spell, is there anything that you do that makes the dizziness worse or better?
Patient Response: Leaning on something and breathing really deep and fast seemed to be the only thing keeping me from losing my cool. Trying to keep going would make it a lot worse.

Doctor Question: Does your family have any significant history of disease?
Patient Response: My dad suffered from some epileptic seizures as a kid and he has blood coagulation problems. That's it as far as I know it. I got my brain checked a few times because I suffered from weekly severe migraines and they found no trace of epilepsy.

Doctor Question: Do you take any medications?
Patient Response: I don't take any medications. Hardly ever. I try to avoid them if I can.

Doctor Question: Any chest discomfort?
Patient Response: Sometimes I feel a searing pain in my chest (left side) every time I take a breath. It's kinda scary but if I chill out for a while, it will go away. It doesn't happen that often. Just sporadically.

Doctor Question: Any trouble breathing during exercise?
Patient Response: I had an appointment with my trainer today and I mentioned my problem to him. It appears that I have been breathing wrong the entire time. I worked out intensely today and I did get a bit dizzy sometimes but nothing like it used to be. I'm not entirely sure that was the cause of the problem, but it might be.

Doctor Question: Do you have Asthma? Any other medical conditions?
Patient Response: I don't have Asthma. No other conditions that I know of."	Which recommendation is most likely to help the patient reduce his dizziness and nausea during workouts based on his symptoms?

True	t_ckihyz6-0	"Confused for three months. Looking for advice determining possibilities.

It's been three months now and I still don't know whats wrong with me. I've had an MRI, two EEGs, and loads of blood test done. I'm soon to have a spinal tap and a sleep study. I've been thinking though, this all started after I spray painted a ton of stuff in my garage. I didn't think it was related since my symptoms disappeared for two weeks about five days after they started. Then then came back and have been progressively getting worse. I was spray painting for about a two week period in my garage with the door open. I didn't stay in there long. I would hold my breath, paint as quickly as possible, then leave the area. A few times I developed a headache but they where really never that bad. I would wait a few days then start painting again. Paint I was using was Rustoleum and Plasti-dip. Could that be the culprit of my issues?
I've been experiencing a handful of symptoms that only seem to get worse overtime. They consist of:

•Memory;
I'm having difficulty remembering recent events, conversations and when something happened. Recently It's gotten so bad that I can't remember things that I've done the day before.

•Cognition;
Having difficulty weather it be school work, watching TV, reading, or just thinking. I have increased difficulty understanding things. I'm constantly confused and have trouble doing the things I once did with ease.

•Tingling
This most commonly occurs in my hands but recently has started happening in my scalp, face and legs.

•Balance
When walking down a hallway or isle, I tend to drift to the right. It feels like someone is pushing or pulling me. I also have a difficult time navigating through smaller areas since my balance is not quite right.

•Drowsiness
No matter how much sleep I get. I always see to be tired and not fully recharged.

basically, I'm stuck with what people call ""brain fog"". I'd like to know if these symptoms sound like those of over exposure to paint fumes and what I should do. All of the tests that I have had done so far have come back either negative or normal. I haven't used any spray paint since. I'm actually scared to!

True	t_ckk93ng-0	"Barely eating anything for 3 days now

I am a 19 year old male, 180cm and 87kgs (I was 89 a week ago). These past 3-4 days I've noticed that I have barely been eating any food over the day. I'm still on summer break so I've been waking up at 10-11am, and haven't been eating anything for breakfast/lunch except a protein drink. 

I do powerlifting and have been training alongside this drop in my diet, but I don't feel weaker at all when I train. I am hungry but as soon as I start eating I lose the desire for the food and promptly stop, cause I can't force it down. I've been averaging 2 meals a day these past 3-4 days, none of them big enough to even come close to my normal caloric intake. 

In addition to this I haven't been sleeping very much, going to bed at around 3-4am and waking up, as previously stated, just before noon.

I've been going through some emotional stuff during this time and i'm wondering if it could be related to that, or if this is the beginning of an eating disorder. I think these are all the details, but I may have forgotten something."	"Doctor Question: Considering the emotional stuff you mentioned, have you thought about the possibility of being clinically depressed?

Which factor best explains the patient’s recent decrease in appetite, given his emotional stress and altered sleep schedule?	An acute gastrointestinal infection preventing adequate food intake	A sudden onset of food allergies leading to aversion	An underlying emotional or depressive factor affecting appetite	Normal fluctuation in appetite due to sporadic eating habits	C

One year old child, no health issues. 

Is a reaction to the mmr vaccination 4 weeks later within the realm of acceptable? He has every symptom of side effects that is normal for that shot, however it is outside the time frame that I was given to expect it.

Thank you very much!"	"Doctor Question: What kind of symptoms?
Patient Response: Started off with him being really cranky and red, sleepy looking eyes for 2 days. The next day brought lack of appetite, extra clingy- seemed to be very uncomfortable, and restless when sleeping. A rash appeared on his face, which I thought was heat rash. It spread down his entire body throughout the day. That night he spiked a fever, 102, but went away with ibuprofen. Upon waking, rash is more pronounced and his face is slightly swollen, loose stools- not quite diarrhea. Still has a fever, but it responds to ibuprofen. Facial swelling diminishes throughout the day. Seems to be getting a dry cough. He is still very uncomfortable without ibuprofen but acts normal when it kicks in. He is eating and drinking enough to not worry about dehydration. Next day is pretty much the same, but rash looks better and he seems better. Today, the rash is still very much there but less pronounced. He seems more comfortable, but not his normal self. Eating better, but not his normal amount. All around, he seems to be improving and much more playful and mobile. He got a flu shot during the time that he was cranky and sleepy looking- I thought it was from teething."

They are a severe allergic reaction to the MMR vaccine requiring immediate emergency evaluation.	They are due to a normal childhood viral infection unrelated to the vaccine.	They are a typical late-onset reaction from the MMR vaccine at four weeks post-vaccination.	They are a mild reaction caused by the recent flu shot.	B
True	t_cktjbiy-0	"Male, chronic nausea for 6 years. Finally diagnosed through stomach biopsy as thrush?

I'm a 21 year old white, British male, 6ft,  weighing about 73kg. 

For the last 6 years I've had countless trips to the doctors, referrals to specialists,  MRI, CT,  and ultrasound scans, and two camera tests down my throat due to chronic nausea that I was experiencing.

Throughout this process, my weight has fluctuated. I had spells in which the nausea would get worse, and I would experience vomiting and complete loss of appetite. During these times, my weight would drop significantly. 

The last camera test involved taking biopsies from my stomach, which finally gave me a diagnosis of what my GP described as 'severe thrush.' 

I am picking up a course of antibiotics tomorrow, but my question is how the heck did I get thrush in my stomach, and what are the potential dangers of having this issue for so long? I can't seem to find any information on male thrush in the stomach, let alone the potential dangers of such a condition. 

I'm fairly sure I have a case of medical negligence, as I was constantly told the nausea was in my head, and that I was young so would get over it. However at this point that doesn't really interest me, I'd just like a bit more information on how this happened,  and what having such a condition for so long has done to me.

Thank you in advance."	"Doctor Question: Did they do any GES (gastric emptying scintillography*)?
Patient Response: Not entirely sure what that is but I was originally diagnosed with a motility disorder. I then had a test where I ate some radiation which ruled that out?"	Which potential danger is most likely associated with having severe thrush in the stomach for an extended period without proper treatment?	It will usually remain confined to the mouth only, causing minimal issues.	It always resolves spontaneously within a few weeks without needing treatment.	It can lead to ongoing gastric irritation, weight loss, and malnutrition from chronic nausea and vomiting.	It invariably causes complete organ failure within days of onset.	C

I wanted a doctor's perspective. I am pursuing sterilization at age 22. This is as informed as it gets (I've been researching options for at least 10 years--that's how awful pregnancy and childbirth sounds).

Patient Response: Sometimes but less pain without condoms. Doctors don't give a shit about that either in my experience. Also its despite the problem I have of too much natural lubricant. Also Maybe condoms aren't effective enough to rely on them and they fail too easily? Or are too expensive to use with a long term partner (I'm planning to be married at some point.) No maybe solution is doctors should stop being so paternalistic and idiotic and actually discuss sterilization. Hysterectomy would be best but sterilization would be an improvement. It would cut down on non functional days immensely."	Which action is most likely to help this patient effectively discuss and explore permanent sterilization options with healthcare providers?	Undergo multiple abortions to prove she does not want children.	Continue attempting hormonal contraceptives, even with severe side effects.	Seek a second opinion from a specialist or an experienced gynecologist, bringing documentation of all side effects and her clear desire for sterilization.	Stop discussing her discomfort and preferences so doctors won’t dismiss her concerns.	C

True	t_cn313k1-0	"My mystery illness - pain and swelling

Hi, I hope maybe someone here can shed some light on what's going!
To start off, I'll fill you in on my basic info. I'm 31 female 5'7"" 150 lbs and caucasian. Daily I take celexa, wellbutrin, omeprazole, singular, zyrtec and a complete women's multivitamin. All of these I've taken for 2+ years, no new meds added. Existing conditions are asthma, allergies, GERD, depression and anxiety disorder. No change in diet.
Ok, now on to my ""mystery illness"". I'll try to give as much detail as possible. Three weeks ago, I noticed the tops of my feet hurt while walking or bending/flexing my feet. The next day the tops of my hands. A day or two later my ankles and wrists joined. I had no swelling that week until a party that weekend. I was standing a lot and took my shoe off because my right foot felt tight and saw that my foot was very swollen and very painful. Swollen from the ankle down to my toes. The next day, still swollen and barely able to walk on it, I promised my husband I'd go to the family doctor. 
By the time I could see the doctor, 3 days later, my left wrist and top of my hand was swollen as well. I also started to have pain in my right leg. It was up my leg to my knee. But this was more in the muscles of my leg and the area behind my knee I call my ""knee pit"". I can't bend my wrists, right knee or ankles barely at all. The doctor said she really wasn't sure what to think. I had blood drawn for the typical lab panel as well as one for lyme disease. I told her how much pain I was in. I can barely wash and dry my hair, cook, clean house or work at this point (I use my hands a lot at work for various tedious tasks). I can't even hook my own bra behind my back. I feel pathetic and helpless. She recommend that I use OTC pain relievers. I already knew these haven't helped, but had hopes of getting an answer from the blood tests if wait it out.
All of my blood work came back normal, I'm really healthy on paper. At this point I'm very frustrated. She recommended I see a rheumatologist and because of my pleading for relief from this extreme pain, gave me a prescription for tramadol. Later on in the week, I had to call and request something else, tramadol didn't even touch the pain. I feel like they think I'm just asking for random pain killers, they make feel like I'm doing something wrong. But, they prescribed mobic anyway. Still not even worth me taking it. Might as well be a pez candy for all it does. The last few days, a couple fingers have started hurting as well. 
Now, the best way I can describe these pains is comparing it to a sprained wrist/twisted ankle/jammed finger. There is extreme pain when I trip over my dog or bend my wrist while pushing off from my chair to stand. These pains are intense and sharp. Heat or cold packs don't help much, but I've used them on the main swollen areas just for temporary relief.
I have no history of arthritis or autoimmune disorders in my family. All of my family is really healthy and they think I'm exaggerating. My rheumatoid factor on the lab work was &lt;10 with the cutoff at &lt;=14. 
I can say that I've been under *extreme* stress for months. Money problems and the possibility of losing my house because of these money problems. Because of money issues, I've had anxiety attacks at work and feel fatigued and depressed with all of the problems compounding into an almost explosive situation. My life feels very out of control, especially with this added complication.
I don't know what to think and I don't know what my next step should be. A rheumatologist I suppose. 
Can anyone help me? Any insight or experience with these types of symptoms would be very much appreciated. I'll answer any questions if there is anything I haven't covered!

1. After a few hours in an AC room/car I feel better which is followed by sneezing and then I have none of the symptoms stated above except I feel very hungry.

2. Feel full of life and very strong. Mind seems relaxed and focused.

3. But after coming back to home all of the above symptoms return

4. It is not due to my home because I have changed 5 rented homes in the past 6 years. I felt the same everywhere.

I don't have an AC at home to determine if the air/dust or anything else is making me allergic.

Does anyone have any idea what ailment I am suffering from? This thing which appears minor has wreaked havoc on me and my life. I am getting treated from an ENT for the past 1 month and he said it is just allergy and only solution is continuous medicine.

I am currently being given Picnovit dietary supplement.

However I feel I am missing some part of the puzzle and if I can get myself healthy I can concentrate on my work and personal life which is moving like a tortoise at this point.

I take adequate water, fruits and eat very healthy foods.

Anyone helping me on this will be doing a huge favour as I have been to every good doctor (physician, ENT, gastro, ayurveda) but all of them only accept it as an allergy. I need a cure/solution however.

Thanks"	"Doctor Question: It could be an animal? or do you use a curtain spray a lot?
Patient Response: I don't have any animal at home. Also don't use any curtain spray."	Which potential explanation best accounts for why the patient’s symptoms significantly improve in an air-conditioned environment?	Sneezing in the cooler air triggers the release of certain hormones that eliminate the symptoms.	Air conditioning helps filter out or reduce airborne allergens that trigger the patient's symptoms.	Being away from the usual home routine encourages more frequent eating, which reduces the symptoms.	Exposure to lower temperatures completely suppresses the immune system’s allergic response.	B

True	t_cux7g9y-0	"Yeast Infection and UTI at the same time?

I (26F) just got off a 10 day antibiotic (Cephalexin) to clear up an infection on my new nose piercing. I ended up removing the nose ring and wasn't able to get a different stud in so the piercing has now closed and is healing nicely. I don't currently have a PCP, so I just saw my dermatologist for this Rx.

I have found that I almost always develop yeast infections while taking antibiotics, so I mentioned this during my appointment and was prescribed Fluconazole at the same time. 

I finished the antibiotics yesterday and took the Fluconazole today. I've noticed some signs that are similar to a UTI, which I am also very prone to. The signs are: feeling like I need to pee, but there's not much urine when I go; some pain in the lower abdomen; and blood in my urine. 

Can a yeast infection and UTI occur simultaneously? Are these just normal side effects of the Fluconazole? These issues only just started today, and I don't want to jump to any unnecessary conclusions. What should I look out for, and when should I see a physician?"	"Doctor Question: Does that help?
Patient Response: That's very helpful - thank you!"	Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion regarding the patient's new urinary symptoms after finishing antibiotics and starting fluconazole?	Blood in the urine is typically a harmless side effect of fluconazole, so the patient can wait for it to clear up without further evaluation.	Since symptoms began immediately after antibiotic therapy, they will likely go away on their own without additional medical attention.	Yeast infections and UTIs can occur simultaneously, and persistent symptoms, especially blood in the urine, warrant a physician’s evaluation.	These symptoms are likely related to lingering discomfort from the nose piercing, so there is no concern for a urinary infection.	C
True	t_cv3gow6-0	"Blurry vision, lightheadedness? Brain tumor?

I've had chronic sinusitis ever since little, but these past 3 or 4 years it's been getting better (no more tonsil infections, rarely any fever). I'm in my 20s.

I've been noticing some sinus related problems 2 weeks ago, most noticeably blood in morning sputum. 

3 days ago with some blurry vision (doesn't improve when covering either eye, but I think I see pretty normally when looking at something up close, like myself in a mirror) and lightheadedness (not vertigo, kind of improves when I lean my head onto something.. normal blood pressure). This was constantly, even up until today. No headaches. 

Yesterday I asked for an MRI, and I had a noncontrast one done (they even said it was this new high end machine.. Perhaps 3T?).

Right after the exam I asked the doctor if he saw anything, he said it was all clear. 

Is there a chance they could've missed a brain tumor since there was no contrast? I know that a contrast MRI is like 99% definitive, but is a noncontrast close? 

Also, if the MRI missed a small tumor for not having contrast, wouldn't it have to be small enough, therefore not causing any of these symptoms? "	"Doctor Question: If you need someone to ask, check with ENT about your sinuses but don't be surprised if you're told to try the usual things that your GP has likely given you like steroid nasal sprays and antihistamines.
Patient Response: As for the sinus problems, my GP first ordered antibiotics, but I consulted a otorhinolaryngologist who told me not to take them, and stick with nasal corticosteroids and anti histamines (even though I have no allergies, I understand it relieves symptoms)."	Which statement best addresses the concern that a small brain tumor might not have been detected by the patient’s noncontrast, high-end MRI?	It is impossible to rule out a tumor if the MRI was done without contrast.	The presence of sinus symptoms automatically means a brain tumor was missed.	A negative high-end MRI without contrast makes a large symptomatic brain tumor unlikely.	A small missed tumor would certainly cause severe headaches and is not linked to sinus problems.	C

I am not sure if this is the correct sub-reddit, but my family is growing desperate and I am hoping the awesome community of reddit can point us in the right direction. 

My younger brother was diagnosed with epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis at six months of age. We have been through multiple resections, treatment methods (VNS,diets, every medication) he has had multiple shunts in place which have failed over and over again. 

We are now at a point where the doctors are giving us no hope, his health is declining quickly and we are running out of options. He was treated for the first 18 years of his life at NYU Langone by their top epilepsy and neuro doctors, he then relocated to Arizona with my family where he has been treated at Childrens hospital and has consulted with Barrows. Over the years we have visited multiple hospitals around the country seeking advice.

This year the doctors informed us his brain is beginning to degenerate he has been placed on palliative care. My parents are flying out to NYU November 9th-14th to see if another opinion can provide us with any hope.

To give a bit a sense of the past year, he is rapidly loosing his short term memory, he has developed severe OCD behaviors, is in a constant state of nausea and discomfort. Through out his early years he was suffering from dozens of short though incoherent seizure episodes which have progressed into what seems non stop small seizures that are constantly debilitating him. He temporarily looses feeling in fingers and has constant twitching which seems to worsen. He head which is rather scarred from repeated surgeries and though has undergone plastic surgery to try and restructure with mesh (for functional reasons) seems to be caving in and areas of the scar are not healing correctly and are constantly getting infected.

As I said I am not sure if I am posting in the correct place, I was hoping to find somewhere to seek experts who could maybe point me in the right direction or further options.

Hey guys!  Thanks in advance for looking this over, and I apologize for it being so long but I'm really trying to be thorough.  I'm a 27-year-old caucasian female from south FL, approximately 5'2"" and currently 140 lbs.  For the past month and a half I've been experiencing terrible, debilitating nausea and abdominal discomfort.  I also have NO appetite -- just the thought of eating makes me feel nauseous.  When I do try to eat I can only ever manage a few bites before I feel uncomfortably full.  

The situation escalated to the point where I lost about 8 lbs in a week and a half (went from 150-142) and I finally went to see a GI in mid-October. They performed an ultrasound of my gallbladder (clean!) and also did some blood work, which also came back clean.  The GI prescribed me 10mg dicyclomine to be taken 3 times a day, as well as a week long course of ciprofloxacin.  I responded well to the dicyclomine at first -- my first two days on the pills I felt almost normal.  But it started to have some diminishing returns pretty quickly, so I spoke with my GI and decided to take it four times a day.  Once again, I'm experiencing some diminishing returns and I am now taking dicyclomine five times a day.  He also recommended I take 20g omeprazole twice a day, which I have been doing for several weeks.  I saw him for a followup on Weds and explained I was still experiencing nausea and difficulty eating, so he's now added a probiotic (Align, taken I believe once daily?  I haven't started yet, I ordered the pills online and they should be arriving today) and he suggested taking a Tums before bedtime (which I have done for the last few days, using ""ultra strength"" Tums.)

Like I said, the medication seemed to work at first.  I went from 142 to 144-46, and I was starting to function almost normally.  I still couldn't eat a lot but the nausea seemed to be resolved by the medication.  After a week I had to increase the dosage but it still mostly resolved my nausea.  Things are looking kind of bleak lately though.  I took my morning dose of omeprazole and dicyclomine about two hours ago and I'm still feeling nauseous, although a bit better than I did this morning.  The nausea is bad enough right now that I don't feel like I could function comfortably outside of my apartment.  I'm also starting to lose weight again (which yay, I guess, but I really wanted to get there through proper diet and exercise, not because I can't eat food.)

Some more relevant information: I experienced a similar situation back in March/April where I felt nauseous and unable to eat.  This lasted about 3-4 weeks, and was not nearly as serious as the nausea I experience now.  I just stuck to a diet of simple chicken broth and saltines until my stomach settled, which it eventually did.  I didn't see a doctor for that.  I had also been losing weight intentionally prior to my stomach issues, approximately 25 lbs before these shenanigans began. Back in June I experienced SEVERE, sharp abdominal pain that lasted for about 4-5 days.  I saw the GI back then as well and he said it was likely a gallbladder attack from the weight loss and he gave me a prescription, but by that point I was actually getting better on my own and didn't end up taking the medication.  Eventually the pain went away completely and I was totally fine pretty much until October when this whole mess started.

Since this is a GI problem I should probably discuss my bowel movements.  Mostly it's been kind of inconsistent, probably because of how wildly my eating habits vary lately.  Some mornings I'll produce several large, soft BMs, other days it's almost nothing all day -- small, hard BMs.  Lately it's been almost nothing, I suspect because I'm having so much trouble eating.  But who knows?  Urine seems to be pretty normal, at least to me.  

The nausea is basically constant but I've only thrown up once this whole time back in October, and what I threw up was literally just a pill and water.  (There was nothing else in my system.)  I feel like if I pushed myself to eat more it would probably end up making me vomit, but I haven't really wanted to try that yet.  Also, the nausea seems to come in waves: it's always present, but sometimes it just gets SO MUCH WORSE before ebbing back to a lower level.  Aside from the nausea I get occasional stomach discomfort (not pain, more like a terrible gnawing sensation, it might just be hunger at this point honestly), fatigue (might be hunger or the dicyclomine), and rarely I get chills (again, probably hunger).  Also, when I went to the GI on Weds it took them a LONG time to get a blood pressure reading for me.  Multiple attempts on each arm, until finally the fifth time the nurse wrapped the sleeve around my forearm and managed to get a reading.  I don't recall what it was but the nurse didn't comment on it, so I'm assuming it was within normal range.  She said the difficulty getting a reading on my blood pressure was probably due to dehydration.  It's pretty difficult for me to swallow liquids without nausea at this point, so it makes sense.  I'm gonna try sipping on some Gatorade today to see if it'll help me be a little less dehydrated.

Full disclosure: before my stomach started misbehaving I vaporized marijuana recreationally, anywhere from .1g to .5g a day.  I used to partake rarely back when I was in California, primarily by using edibles.  I stopped for 6 months after moving from California to a fully illegal state and only resumed usage back in early August.  All told I've probably enjoyed weed for a total of about a little over a year, but only since August did I become a daily user. Vaporizing the larger amounts (like .5g/day) is also a fairly recent development that I started in RESPONSE to my nausea, I was definitely using smaller amounts when this all started.  I'm mentioning this because I have heard of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, and while I'm fairly certain I don't have CHS I figure it's worth throwing out there as an option.  I will say that I just took a hot shower that seemed to relieve my symptoms temporarily, but again I almost never vomit (which I understand is a hallmark symptom of CHS and CVS) so it just doesn't seem very likely.  I'm abstaining from marijuana for the next few days just to be sure, but I have to say that it is difficult because marijuana is about the only thing that seems to reliably alleviate my symptoms.  It's also the only way I can manage to eat more than two bites of something without wanting to puke it all back up.  On that note, if cannabis isn't the cause of my symptoms is it still safe for me to use it to treat my nausea?  (Yes, I understand ""safe"" is kind of a relative term when you're getting it from a dealer rather than a medical dispensary, but I do trust my guy and nobody else appears to be getting sick from his product.)  I understand that marijuana can slow gut motility, and if my issue is related to gastroparesis then I definitely don't want to exacerbate the problem, you know?  I have not yet disclosed my marijuana usage to my GI (he hasn't asked yet and he's a friend of the family, so I can't help but feel a little paranoid that he'd tell my folks) but if it is relevant I will obviously do so.

Extra relevancy in case anyone thinks it might be IBS: I menstruated this week and it didn't really seem to effect my symptoms, either for better or for worse, but as my period tapered off the nausea started to get really bad.  Other than that it was a pretty normal period.  Not sure if it's relevant, but I know IBS symptoms can worsen during menstruation.   

And I think that's about it?  To me the current possibilities seem like it might be IBS, Crohn's, gastroparesis...  But I'm not a doctor, thank god!  My GI thinks it's either my gallbladder or a particularly nasty virus -- he said some might cause symptoms for up to six months, so I guess it's possible!  But I'd love to hear any feedback you guys might have.  I have another followup with my GI scheduled for December but if the nausea continues like this and abstaining from marijuana doesn't resolve the issue then I might bump that up a couple of weeks.  It's really, really hard to live like this.  Right now the dicyclomine helps a little but it's just not enough anymore.  Any and all help/insight you guys could offer would just be hugely appreciated.  "	"Doctor Question: Have you ever tried an elimination diet to see if you have started reacting to certain foods?

True	t_cx7452u-0	"Mystery Stomach Problems Causing Misery :(

Hey guys!  Thanks in advance for looking this over, and I apologize for it being so long but I'm really trying to be thorough.  I'm a 27-year-old caucasian female from south FL, approximately 5'2"" and currently 140 lbs.  For the past month and a half I've been experiencing terrible, debilitating nausea and abdominal discomfort.  I also have NO appetite -- just the thought of eating makes me feel nauseous.  When I do try to eat I can only ever manage a few bites before I feel uncomfortably full.  

The situation escalated to the point where I lost about 8 lbs in a week and a half (went from 150-142) and I finally went to see a GI in mid-October. They performed an ultrasound of my gallbladder (clean!) and also did some blood work, which also came back clean.  The GI prescribed me 10mg dicyclomine to be taken 3 times a day, as well as a week long course of ciprofloxacin.  I responded well to the dicyclomine at first -- my first two days on the pills I felt almost normal.  But it started to have some diminishing returns pretty quickly, so I spoke with my GI and decided to take it four times a day.  Once again, I'm experiencing some diminishing returns and I am now taking dicyclomine five times a day.  He also recommended I take 20g omeprazole twice a day, which I have been doing for several weeks.  I saw him for a followup on Weds and explained I was still experiencing nausea and difficulty eating, so he's now added a probiotic (Align, taken I believe once daily?  I haven't started yet, I ordered the pills online and they should be arriving today) and he suggested taking a Tums before bedtime (which I have done for the last few days, using ""ultra strength"" Tums.)

Like I said, the medication seemed to work at first.  I went from 142 to 144-46, and I was starting to function almost normally.  I still couldn't eat a lot but the nausea seemed to be resolved by the medication.  After a week I had to increase the dosage but it still mostly resolved my nausea.  Things are looking kind of bleak lately though.  I took my morning dose of omeprazole and dicyclomine about two hours ago and I'm still feeling nauseous, although a bit better than I did this morning.  The nausea is bad enough right now that I don't feel like I could function comfortably outside of my apartment.  I'm also starting to lose weight again (which yay, I guess, but I really wanted to get there through proper diet and exercise, not because I can't eat food.)

I know that hypothyroidism usually has weight gain as a symptom, but what about the other way around? I mean ...

They found I had hypothyroidism but since my numbers were low they said ""let's wait a few months and do the test again"". I dieted during that time and lost weight. We did the test again and the results were better? So that was it, they didn't give me the medication.

Now I gained weight again and I feel the same symptoms... constant tiredness being the main one. Is it possible the weight is a factor?

Thank you.

Recently I decided enough is enough, feeling worthless and not doing anything this semester at college was hurting me more than ever. I stopped going to class and doing work.

To preface, i take very great care of myself... I even use a vagasil pH balance cleanser. I shower....go to the gym almost every day...i eat right... I haven't had sex in two months (with an ex boyfriend that I was with since august) so I don't know if it's an std. He claims to have been tested after we broke up, too. And that his results weren't positive.

The other night I come home from work after an overtime shift...and once I got comfortable, my vagina started itching like CRAZY. Like, so much that I even started to slap and punch it. It was AWFUL. I also noticed a thick white discharge when I went to the bathroom. Sounds like a yeast infection, right? That's what I thought...but then the same night, I start getting a brown discharge....then the next day its a LOT of brown discharge. So last night I decided to wear a pad because I also started spotting. So when i come home from dinner with friends, my pad is fresh with a LOT of BROWN... And only a little blood. 

And this morning, just now, I check my new pad...and there's nothing. I also got slight cramps here and there yesterday...but they were very temporary. I analyzed my vagina with a mirror to check for any signs, and I see that one side of my labia is pale...like, discolored. When the rest is all pink and just vagina-colored. And it hurt when I touched the inside of my vagina.

I don't know if this is also important, but a couple days earlier i threw up at work and had terrible nausea. But I figured it was just the chipotle I had a day prior...but just in case, I'm including that. No sex for two months. So I don't know what it is. I made an appointment with a gyno next Thursday....so we'll see what she says but for now I just want a clue, if i can even get one. Please help. Thanks!

Hi docs,

Thank you for your support! My dad has Stage IV lung cancer, and has asked me to look into the medical marijuana route. Looking online, there are actually some pretty convincing arguments for taking it to combat cancer (look up ""Rick Simpson Oil""). He is pretty weak, has already gone through 5 infusions of chemo (it stopped working), immunotherapy, and palliative radiation treatments.

Anyways, my Dad is currently on the Fentanyl patch for severe pain due to metastases in his back. I plan to make him cannabis oil (THC) to not only assist him with his pain, but also to perhaps assist with his treatment.

Question: are Fentanyl and Cannabis known to have a severe adverse interaction? He is not on any other serious meds besides his twice-monthly immunotherapy treatment (Nivolumab / Opdivo), which also doesn't appear to be working.

DETAILS:

Age: 75

Gender: Male

Height/Weight: 5 feet, 6 inches / 170lbs

Race: Italian

Thank you docs!!!

edit: please no responses such as ""this won't work"", as we'll likely try it either way. If anything, it will serve to keep him optimistic. I'm really just looking to learn about any potential drug interactions if possible. Thanks!!!"	"Doctor Question: Has he seen a palliative care specialist?

Currently applied for two seperate programs to help cover surgery or at least reduce costs.

My question is what can I do to make the pain manageable. Currently losing sleep and my mental sanity. Have been dealing with the pain for over 5 years now before being diagnosed.

Over the next few years, I got my anemia under control, and now I'm looking to lose the weight.

This post is regarding my wife.  white female 32,  175lbs living in the Midwest.  She has been hospitalized for excessive vomiting  5 times in the past 3 years.  It got to the point where she was forced to leave her job. So far  the prescribed medications have not helped her symptoms.  She was diagnosed with cyclical vomiting syndrome,  but beyond that have not been given a definitive cause. 

My wife is a life long asthmatic.  She was diagnosed with pcos and type 2 diabetes about 14 years ago.  About 4 years ago she had her gallbladder removed due to lack of function.  The first time she was admitted for the vomiting she was diagnosed with gastroparesis.  

The vomiting usually starts off with heavy mucus and leads into vomiting pure bright  yellow bile.  Antiemetics have no effect on the vomiting.  When she is admitted she is found to have high blood sugar and in diabetic ketoacidosis.   She then is given high doses of insulin which doesn't bring her blood sugar down until the vomiting subsides.  Her wbc is always elevated as well.  Somewhere between 8 to 9 thousand.

The first time she was admitted it took 10 days for her to stop vomiting.  The second time was for 5 days; third for 3 days; fouth for an overnight,  and the fifth for 8 days.  
The vomiting would usually start while she was at work and would usually stop after she got home and got some sleep.  The vomiting seems to be aggravated by allergens such as dust and cigarette smoke,  but can be triggered with seemingly no cause. 

She watches her blood sugar and is usually between 110 and 125. When the vomiting begins it shoots up to 250 to 400. Insulin and metformin has no effect on it at that point.  

The only remedy we have found that has any positive effect is cannabis.  As long as she can get some in her system before the vomiting gets out of hand she is fine. After over 2 years of daily vomiting she is finally to a state where she can function and is only vomiting on rare occasions. Unfortunately we live in a state where cannibis is illegal.   She recently applied for a job but was rejected fue to thc being found on her drug screening. 

Does anyone know of any other remedy for cvs or what what else this could be.  We have very large medical bills from the extended hospital stays and a plethora of specialists. We are currently without insurance.

My fiancee is 35 years old (Caucasian) and was born with Spina Bifida (Lipomyelomeningocele) with neurogenic bowel and bladder.  This condition comes with its own set of challenges which she has been dealing with for her entire life.  

She has almost no feeling at all below the knee and has to use leg braces and a crutch to walk short distances and a wheelchair for long distances.

I tell you all that to give her medical background.  The real issue currently is that she has frequent leg spasms every day (pain shooting down to her foot and pulsing).  During a normal day, she will have spasms for roughly 1-2 hours per day.  On days where she has a fever, it gets much worse and she has them every 10 minutes for the duration of the fever (sometimes all day).

Her doctor told her the spasms weren't something normally associated with Spina Bifida but that she'd have to get used to them but I'm hoping someone out there has experience with something similar and hopefully can point us in a direction that may at least limit some of the pain she is going through each day.

So I noticed a few months from now I started having lots of mood swings
Basically what would happen was that sometimes I would ""being on the top of the world and nothing could bring me down"" feeling though I felt very *irritated* if someone told me to do some work or something. Sometimes I was too depressed/anxious, hating my life, my family etc (though I never had suicidal thoughts) and even a tiny thing like what someone said would make me anxious and sad, I have also seen that being a little hungry made  me be a little happy and being too hungry usually worsened the anxiety 
I attributed these mood swings to puberty but these mood swings are worsening, sometimes to the point I can't study due to me being in a too good mood or too bad mood.                         
Also I sometimes very rarely tend to have a blank kind of phase, where the normal thing that made me happy (like thinking about my crush or playing the new game I brought) does not effect me and the sad feeling went away too, I ignored them because I think it is puberty but yesterday my facial muscles kind of trembled when I was trying to smile, I don't think it was due to the cold.

There are two main things that could be causing it:

2. I just got home from a week in the mountains.

I've been trying to do research to quantify how bad/out of range these are, but all I can find is what normal levels are. The week before I took the test I had been on vacation and did a reasonably heavy amount of drinking. The night before I had somewhere between 2 and 4 ounces of a fairly low ABV beer.

I spoke to my doctor who seemed concerned and asked that I abstain from drinking for 2 - 3 weeks and retake these tests but didn't really give me an idea of how ""bad"" these results were, whether they're indicative of significant liver damage, etc. He did state that over my last 3 tests my platelets have been dropping somewhat (119 a little over a year ago, a bit higher but still ""low"" before that).

In the interest of me not spending the next 3 weeks freaking out about the unknown, are these numbers enough to say anything at all or do i just need to wait and see what the next test says?"	"Doctor Question: Where do you live?
Patient Response: I'm in Connecticut. Haven't found any ticks latched onto me nor seen any engorged ones around me. I did by chance have a Lyme test done with this same set of tests since I'd had a small mark that looked a little bit bullseye-ish, but it came back clear."	Which statement best reflects the significance of the patient's lab results given his history of recent alcohol consumption and a declining platelet count trend?	They confirm a new tick-borne infection, making immediate treatment with antibiotics mandatory.	These results suggest advanced cirrhosis and irreversible liver damage.	They are completely within normal limits and require no further evaluation.	The slightly elevated liver enzymes and mildly decreased platelet count may be related to recent alcohol intake but require follow-up testing after abstinence.	D

True	t_dnec4td-0	"24F diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis

Hi all, 

So two days ago I was diagnosed with DVT after going to the ER for excruciating pain in my left calf. It was a rather busy night for the nurses and I was so baffled by the diagnosis I didn't think to ask all the right questions. 

I would first really like to know what to do to alleviate the pain. It seems to get worse every day although I have been injecting myself with Fraxiparine (an anticoagulant) since the diagnosis. I have been trying to keep my leg elevated but even on top of pillows, when my calf muscle touches the surface of anything, it feels like it's being torn apart and ready to snap. 

The same feeling occurs whenever I try to walk. I am incapable of straightening my leg, as it feels like the worst, most painful cramp all along the calf. Do you know if this is normal? And if so, any idea how long before I can walk again? 

And finally, I would like to know if there is anything I should absolutely avoid doing as to not aggravate my situation. I suppose the nurses would still have told me, but I keep thinking about those clots detaching themselves and making their way up my body and it worries me sick. For example, can I touch my leg, massage it a bit? Can I try to walk? Can I eat greasy food, like fast food? And I know that you will advise me not to, but as a smoker, I really feel like having just one or two cigarettes before quitting indefinitely. This really was a wake up call for me and I realise how bad that stuff is, but if any of you ever tried to quit I guess you can understand how difficult this is. But then, do you think that one or two cigarettes can have direct consequences?

True	t_dnjdhed-0	"How to cure dermatitis without prescription

Some background - I first got dermatitis around 10 years ago. 
Doctor after doctor (I move house a lot so change GP) told me to use 1% Hydrocortisone. When that didn't work they just told me to keep it moisturised. Which also never worked.
Eventually after 6 years I found a competent doctor who (completely bemused that I hadn't been given this earlier) gave me some kind of stronger steroid cream. It went away in a week, and stayed away for 4 years.

Now it's back. And my wonderful competent doctor is back home, while I'm living in Australia. My current GP has again given me 1% hydrocortisone and insisted I just keep moisturising when that didn't work. I've told him about it being cured before with something stronger but he won't give me anything.

My hands sting, itch and burn SO much and I cannot stand it when I KNOW there is a cure that apparently nobody in my vicinity with a medical degree has done enough dermatological research to give to me.

19F, 153cm(5'0), 39kg(86lbs). 

I was recently diagnosed with mild lumbar levoscoliosis. The doctor said that the left side of my pelvis is higher than the right side, which means my right leg is the short one, but my left leg appears a little shorter and more muscular and the right leg looks weaker and longer. 

The arch of the left leg is also more dropped than the one on the right, that's why I was told to wear supportive foot wear. Now, the  right foot needs to have a supportive shoe with a 0.4mm higher heel, which would balance my pelvis, but make my left leg look even shorter. I also don't know how this will affect my scoliosis.

Here's the background: I'm 24 &amp; still in school. Therefore, I am still on my parents insurance. Up until a couple of years ago, I was class 2 obese, so I never really had success with the ladies.

Today, I'm only ~10 lbs overweight and have much more success.... sort of. Every girl that I've gone home with, I've been unable to get 'it' up.

It is so stressful just to carry out conversations because I can't remember words and often have trouble putting my thoughts into sentence form even when I can remember the words. It results in a lot of awkward pauses when I'm trying to speak and a lot of people getting impatient and finishing my sentences for me. I also have a very hard time reading now.

Edit: Forgot health details. Male, 18, 5' 10"", 250lb, no heart issues. Daily weed smoker of nearly a year, multiple times a day.

Alrighty so yesterday I was walking to the bathroom all the way from the garage (Detached building in the backyard).

About 1/4 way up the steps to the second floor I get a weird feeling in my gut and a sudden heavyness. I brushed off the heaviness as the weed I was smoking beforehand and the stomach sensation as just really needing to go to the washroom. I had just been in 10 minutes prior so I figured my stomach was just upset. I make it up the short steps and it gets worse. My mind connects the gut sensation to a few experiences where I pass out or feel like I am coming close. I should've just sat down right away but that requires good fore-thought. I get a few steps into the bathroom and then darkness...

Next thing I know I am on the floor with my heart beating out of my chest, cold, covered in sweat, and towels. I cannot bring myself to open my eyes because of an overwhealming sound of blood circulating. All I can focus on for the next 30 seconds (but felt like an eternity) is the sound and how human are not supposed to hear it normally. I open my eyes, slowy sit up, and try to gather together what happened. I stand with the same stability of a newborn calf and stumble to the kitchen to let my grandma know I was all right and what happened. She makes sure I am alright and I quickly go lay down on reclining chair and let myself stabalise for a few minutes. 

Once I no longer feel like I am about to die, I get up and move all the towels to the hamper. I was quite surprised when I uncovered the towel bar and saw my damage. I had bent the square folded metal pole into a near 90 degree angle with what I presume was my head. I take the pole out to the garage to show my dad and try to calm down. I get yelled at to go make a doc's appointment (Which I hate, the nurses are rude to me but nice to him) for the 23rd.
I come back, I still have this overwhealming omen of fear over me (I still kind of do) and come back to calm down and smoke a bowl.

When I was 17, I started exhibiting an eye twitch. Was referred to neurologist and diagnosed with a “Tic.” I was prescribed Atarax 10mg. The medication worked and I stopped taking it once I ran out of the first bottle. 

I couldn’t feel the actual “ticking,” it didn’t feel like an “itch” or an impulse commonly attributed with Tics. I had no idea when it would happen and people would just be like “woah your eye just spazzed out.” At the time, I was under a lot of stress and in a school play so I was busy a lot and not sleeping enough and had social anxiety. 

Since then, no one has pointed out the twitch and my parents claim they haven’t seen me do it in years. It was pretty sporadic and disappeared just the same.

My parents described the twitch as a repetitive blinking but it would only happen in one eye. I’ve never seen nor felt myself do it. They said it would come out towards the end of the day or if I was talking about something that made me angry or excited. 

I’m just curious as to what it was, I’ve read a lot on Tourette’s Syndrome and have watched many documentaries on tics and I feel like my symptoms were not the same thing.

I was admitted to the ER on thanksgiving for a 4cm ovarian cyst, kidney stone, and a UTI so bad I was only peeing blood not urine. I was given 10mg IV morphine to start and 4mg thereafter. I was told by my ER doctor he couldn’t prescribe me pain meds because I already had my pain management prescription, but to take extra if the pain got too bad which of course it did and I ran out early. 3 days ago I was back in the ER for a lump on my neck directly on top of my VP shunt (a tube that goes from my brain to my abdomen and drains excess spinal fluid for a condition called Pseudotumor Cerebri). I needed surgery that day to replace the tube that broke. I have a 3 inch incision in the middle of my abdomen and a bigger one along my skull/neck. My surgeon prescribed enough oxycodone 20mg (my normal dosage per pain management) to last 2 days and told me I should be able to get my pain management doctor to release my refill a few days early due to my circumstances. I was refused and shocked because during my 3 years in pain management I’ve never asked for more pain meds because I finished them early. I’ve never been in this situation before where I needed a surprise surgery. And I’m being refused help from the hospital, my primary, and pain management...now I understand why so many people turn to heroin, they have no other option.

Hi everyone, im not sure if im in the right subreddit for this kind of question but I figure it can't hurt. Im asking on behalf of my mother who's dealing with somewhat advanced rheumatoid arthritis. We have a shower that is becoming increacingly difficult for her to use because of it having sliding doors with a ledge to step over and it being slippery on the floor. Does anyone have any ideas for how to make this easier? Any advice or product reccomendation would help. Thanks! (Read further for her own description of her condition if that helps)

Background: Mother is 52, current weight 280lbs after losing 85 lbs with weight loss surgery in 9 months.  

She is having attacks lately where she loses motor control (can't stand up), slurs her speech and cries hysterically in high stress situations.  She is mentally aware and has full recollections of all details during the attacks, and is even aware enough during the attacks to ask for things unrelated to her situation (like the the cat out, get me my blood pressure tester, etc).  Her blood pressure readings during these attacks are elevated but not health crisis levels (150/95 is average I'd say), afterwards when the attack ends in typically 15 to 30 minutes it drops to normal levels around 130-135/90 and she returns to normal completely with no issues with motor function.

Her doctor thought these attacks were stress related and had her do several MRI's and CT scans to rule out stroke symptoms due to the loss of motor control.  These scans were also reviewed by a neurologist who signed off that he saw no stroke signs.  He put her on lexipro, and she has been taking it for about 30 days.

Hello,

I'm an early 20s female, and I've been having on/off pelvic pain for the last few months, which seems to have gotten worse today. 

Roughly 3 months ago, I noticed a sharp pain in the side of my pelvic region (sort of where my pubic bone meets my thigh), when urinating. I thought it was a UTI, so I drank a lot of water, peed a lot, and the pain went away after a day. The same thing happened again, about a month later. That time, it took roughly two days to go away. I have no other symptoms aside from this pain. No frequency, no other pain, no nausea, nothing. My urine looks completely normal, too.

I seem to be having the same issue today, however, I'm feeling the pelvic pain when walking/moving my legs in certain positions, along with urinating. I also noticed it while laughing loudly (maybe the stretching of my stomach muscles caused it?). The pain isn't getting any more severe, and I have no other symptoms aside from pain when urinating. I'm assuming this will also go away in 1-2 days, but I'm wondering if anyone here knows what this could be?

* No results on CT scan

Patient Response: So far, there seem to be no triggers. She's kept a journal in the past, and the closest thing we can guess is that it might be stress related, but the migraines don't always line up the right way, so it's inconclusive at best.

Patient Response: As far as describing 'chronic', she got her first one around five or six years old. That were sparse in the beginning, but have increased by amount and severity over the years. Sometimes she'll have a relatively good week or month, but otherwise, she typically has a constant low-grade headache at all times, and typically got at least one migraine a week up until around the last six months to a year.

Patient Response: She hasn't had as many good weeks, and the last three months have seen multiple migraines a week with full light sensitivity, and often accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting.

Patient Response: Regular days headaches are around a 2-4 pain level, whereas migraines are often 7-10. And she has a high threshold for pain after dealing with the Endo cramps for most of her teenage and young adult life. Forgot to mention that fibromyalgia is in the running for other problems (constant mid-grade body pain, etc.) And that it may be associated, but it has stayed the same over the past year, whereas only the migraines have gotten worse.

Current medications (if any) - Liv52 and few vitamin complexes


So few weeks back I had a kind of weird viral fever where it would rise in afternoon and by night it'd subside. After 3 days I was told to took little paracetamol and to take plenty of rest. In two days the fever symptoms went but I couldn't eat well. I also noticed that my urine steadily turning darker despite me trying to drink enough water (even ORS). When the urine turned orangish in morning I thought something might be funny with my liver. I got my blood tested for liver functions and jaundice was confirmed (by this time my sclera turned yellow).

From then I've been on a strict diet of light foods. The doctor suggested I drink plenty of coconut water, but I dislike it I'm a way autistic people find foods repulsive - it's physically discomforting and my body shudders while it goes ""nope"". I couldn't explain this to doc and dumbly said yes to everything he said.

I want to know if there are any substitutes for coconut water. From what I've read, watermelon is an alternative but isn't in season. Note that I can drink mature coconut water (from dried, brown coconuts) but not render coconut. Will ORS suffice? How much can be too much?

Started about 2-3 weeks ago, symptoms have peaked the past couple days

First started about 2 weeks ago.  I had a panic attack (I think) and just about thought i was having a stroke.  I had tunnel vision, pins and needles in my fingers, increased heart rate, faintness.  It lasted about an hour.

Two weeks later, I've been feeling low on energy, I have history of depression.  When I lay down to go to sleep, I keep feeling jolts in my chest that seem like heart flutters.  Then it feels like my BP drops, I get faint, sweaty palms, increased heart rate. Hyperventilating. I try to do breathing exercises to calm down.  I go into full panic mode.  I get very faint, confused, anxious, sense of impending doom as is my heart is going to stop.  I convince myself that it was just a panic attack like two weeks before.

After a couple hours, I finally manage to fall asleep.  I JOLT awake at 6 am after only a few hours asleep to what feels like another heart flutter (again, can't confirm it is a flutter it just feels that way). A few minutes later I managed to fall asleep again but I JOLT awake even harder straight to my and start hyperventilating, burst into tears from fear and tiredness and drive to the hospital.

At the hospital, I tell the same story.  The doc orders an EKG, a bunch of blood work, urine tox and a chest x-ray.  They come up empty.  I seem healthy, however, they didn't test for T3/T4.  Also, I did a bump of cocaine last weekend and that shows up in the UT.  So, they diagnose me with panic disorder and drug use.  Discharged.

Here's the thing, I don't feel like I have panic disorder.  I don't have any history of it.  This is a physical problem that's happening in my body and causing me to panic.  It happens intermittently but almost ALWAYS when I lay down to rest.  It happens in my sleep, or when I'm awake.

So tonight it happened again, and I'm sitting on the couch doing the best I can to recover from it, but now I have a fear of lying down.

I've researched my symptoms and it seems like it could be hyperthyroidism.  Heart flutters, faintness, lack of energy, anxiety.  It all adds up.

*Current medications (if any)*: Ritalin SR and LA [stopped taking LA]; fish oil tablets; Sudafed; B12 tablet; caffeine pills (on occasion)

I'm at the end of my rope. I've been going to physicians, eye doctors, and sinus experts and my problem has worsened to the point where it is impossible for me to look, focus, or read in a straight line. This has hindered my school work considerable, made part-time work needlessly cumbersome, ruined certain recreational activities, and has made life generally miserable.

Long story long: about about three or so years, the peripheral vision in my right eye was becoming modestly worse; it had become harder to see movement and environments on my far-right side. I took a peripheral vision exam (and was never contacted the results, so I guess that's a good sign?) and had learned to just deal with it. I then got my vision rechecked by an optometrist who noticed nothing unusual beyond a discrepancy of vision loss between the two eyes; my suspicion that one of my eyes had become lazy was therefore thwarted (I guess, since he probably would have noticed that) and I got a new pair of glasses that would hopefully accommodate me.

Since then, my right eye's ability to focus without strain had worsened and had been coupled by other concurrent issues. I started experiencing heavy sinusitis on my right side and decided to visit a sinus specialist, who then found an infection and gave my some Nasonex so treat it. Though subsequent visits showed that the infection has depleted, clogging and difficulty breathing had still persisted. He booked a cranal scan for my sinus and mid-head area (and I was never contacted the results, so I guess that's a good sign?) though since there was no longer a visible infection, all he could do was recommend for me to continue with the Nasonex.

Well, I've been taking Nasonex since then but the problem has not subsided and I've further noticed a numbing of my right side; sensations were increasingly numb, my eyelid had become droopy and facial movements have been biased to my left side. I grew paranoid and wondered if my stimulants (like Ritalin or Sudafed) was causing this so I ceased treatment and sought advice from my doctor. He informed me that it was possibly Bell's Palsy and that the issue was either gonna fix itself or stay permanent. Welp, suppose that was earnest insight though the numbness was worsened to the point where I can literally feel numb on my right side - whether I'm on or off of meds. There's no visual palsy beyond that crooked smile though I do notice that my vision mildly improves if I use my hand to forcefully lift my right eyelid.

Basically, this has gotten so bad that I can't focus my right eye well enough to read. My academic performance has dropped to the point of failed standing and I can no longer read anything past the midway of a sentence without having to blink profusely or look away due to strain. It's agonizing, and I feel like a hypochondriac since any inquiry I've ever made has yielded no answers.

Am I losing my mind? Have I been seeing the wrong people? Are all these problems unrelated?

If anyone has any feedback, huge thanks in advance. I'm sitting here at nearly 5am, trying to do an assignment, and all I can think about is this obnoxious matter that is consuming my focus."	"Doctor Question: Have you been seen by an ophthalmologist and a neurologist?
Patient Response: Yeah, the sinus doctor I saw was technically an ophthalmologist. Very nice man though I could tell that he was getting impatient with me by the last appointment. Haven't seen him in over a year though I'll be sure to maybe check up with him and see if he could refer me to somebody who could maybe do a more thorough scan (like a neurologist)."	What is the most appropriate next step in addressing the patient’s persistent right-sided facial numbness, droopy eyelid, and difficulty focusing, despite prior sinus and eye evaluations?	Begin a new course of antibiotics for potential unresolved sinus infection	Obtain a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation	Revisit an optometrist for a new vision prescription	Stop all current medications, including nasal steroid and Ritalin	B
True	t_e9sek3v-0	"[34/m] Treatment Resistant Depression, I have a question about ECT

I've been having problems with my therapist because he essentially told me he can only see me one more time since I'm not ""coming around."" He tried approaching my sessions from a religious standpoint and refuses to allow me to get meds, which I've asked for directly. 

I asked for a test to be done to find out which kind of needs might work best for me but he refused that too. So I talked to my PCP. He told me that since I'm not having any luck with the medication that I should consider ECT. 

I've read some medical journals about the subject but I'm very nervous about it. I've read that there can be months of memory loss and I might need a few treatments. I won't lie, I'm scared. 

What can I expect if I decide to go this route? I don't see the specialist for a few weeks, I just don't want to psych myself out of a treatment that I need. I've tried everything else, this is my last chance."	"Doctor Question: Have you seen any other therapists?
Patient Response: I've seen several therapists in the last couple years.

Doctor Question: It's not clear to me whether you've taken some and they haven't helped or you've never taken any.
Patient Response: I've been on about 15 medications from Prozac and Lexipro to Wellbutrin and Remeron. Nothing works for more than a couple months."	Which statement best reflects what the patient can expect from ECT based on their situation?	ECT is typically only recommended for mild depression where single medication therapy has not been tried.	Memory loss is a potential side effect of ECT, and multiple treatment sessions may be needed for sustained improvement.	ECT cannot be used if the patient has tried more than ten different antidepressants in the past.	ECT is always done without anesthesia or any form of sedation.	B

If a patient with a history of self-harm intentionally cuts themselves again and goes to the ER claiming the injury was accidental, which outcome is most likely according to standard practice?	Healthcare professionals will unconditionally accept the patient's explanation and discharge them immediately.	The patient will be refused medical treatment if they haven't admitted self-harm.	The team will treat the wound, evaluate mental health risk, and may arrange psychiatric admission if needed.

I'm stuck and I feel like everything is screwed up and part of me wants to use cutting to kill myself.

Doctor Question: Have you tried to occupy your mind with something else when these thoughts come into your head?
Patient Response: I haven't had motivation to do something to distract myself. But I'm connecting with family and friends, I'll be ok tonight."	Which statement best reflects what may happen if you go to an ER with a potentially self-inflicted cut that needs stitches?	They will always hospitalize you immediately without further questions.	You can simply claim it was an accident, and they will discharge you without any concerns.	Healthcare providers typically perform a mental health evaluation to assess risk, and hospitalization may occur if you’re deemed a danger to yourself.	You are free to leave at any time, as long as the cut is properly stitched, regardless of mental health considerations.	C

He is currently otherwise healthy (no other existing medical conditions.) He is also not on any medication. Geographically, we are located in North Texas.

He doesn't have a Reddit, so I'm posting on his behalf. Here's what he's telling me:

The back left corner of my throat feels swollen. Not the center like a normal cold. Specifically the corner and only on one side. It's very painful to swallow. 1-10 scale, 10 being extreme pain, it's like a 7. It started two days ago and has steadily gotten worse. It started hurting yesterday but I was still able to swallow. Today it hit 7, and now it hurts a lot.

Here's where it's weirder- I have no other symptoms. No coughing, body aches, fevers, headaches, congestion, runny nose, etc. You can't even tell I'm sick if I'm talking to you. My voice is completely normal.

A 19-year-old shaved her leg in a shared dorm shower, got a small cut that bled slightly, and possibly touched the shower curtain. Which of the following statements best describes the risk of HIV transmission in this scenario?	She may be at a moderate risk of HIV infection and should start post-exposure prophylaxis immediately.	She needs to be tested for HIV weekly for the next few months to rule out any possible exposure.	She should thoroughly clean and disinfect the shower and shower curtain to reduce the high risk of transmission.	There is essentially no risk, as HIV does not survive well on surfaces and requires direct contact with infected blood.	D

I’m a 21 year old white female. I weight 135 lbs and am 5’7”. Lately (the past month) I have been beyond exhausted. I sleep around 9-10 hours a night and cannot get through the day without another 2-4 hour nap. My school work is suffering as well as my social life. 

I have had many blood tests for other concerns before (I have gone for fatigue before, but never this severe), with no abnormal results. I also suffer from chronic migraines (1 or 2 a week) with no known cause (most likely stress). I do receive therapy for anxiety/depression, but have been doing fine in that aspect. 
 
Besides the migraines, my only complaint is the severe fatigue. It takes me around an hour and a half to wake up in the morning because I physically cannot keep my eyes open. I usually set an alarm for a 20-30 minute nap during the day, but always end up having to go back to sleep because of the same issue of being unable to open my eyes. The weirdest part is that even if I set an alarm for a 15 minute nap, I will have had the most vivid and intense dream by the time my alarm goes off. I thought this is super weird because I didn’t think you are supposed to dream so soon after falling asleep. I do also experience these intense dreams during the night, at times not being able to tell if it was a dream or actually happened.

**TL:DR: Nightly muscle cramps in one pinpoint spot under my rib cage**

**UPDATE**:   A day after this post, I developed a raised rash on my back that later spread to my stomach.  Went to Dr today and they confirmed that I have Shingles.

About six days ago I noticed what feels like a pulled muscle right below and maybe slightly underneath my bottom rib on my right side.  It is in one pinpoint spot and doesn't radiate out or down.  I was not doing anything strenuous at the time; had just gotten up from desk/computer.

Occasionally during the day but especially in the evening and overnight I will get intense muscle cramps/spasms in that spot.  The interval is irregular but can be as frequent as every 2-3 seconds for an extended period of time.  The sharp pains are enough to wake me or keep me awake.

Laying on my left (opposite) side cases the cramps to be worst; laying on my right (same) side feels a little better.  No noticeable impact when sitting or standing. Ibuprofen does seems to help with the nightly re-occurring cramps but some occasional cramping still occurs.

History: age - late 30s; sex - male; height: 178cm; weight: 77.4kg (BMI = 24.5); race - ?; duration - 6 days; location - described above; current meds - GERD treated by daily Rx, seasonal allergies treated by daily OTC; past issues -I had thrown out my lower back 11 months ago but no continuing issues from that.

True	t_ecfzh3o-0	"Chest pains

So, I am a 27 year old female, 5’2, 128lbs white, USA. I don’t take any medication. I have been having chest pains for a few years now. They are really intense and get worse if I take a deep breath. Normally it just hurts right under my breast on the left side. It’s like a burning sharp pain. Sometimes I barely notice it, sometimes it’s insanely painful. When it’s at its worst it effects other parts of my body. My stomach also hurts, mostly next to my left hip bone. my neck, jaw, and shoulder become stiff and hurt, and then I can’t feel my left arm and it’s in pain. Like it’s dead weight and tingly but it still hurts. 

So I went to see a doctor about it, I haven’t been since I was a kid so this was a new doctor. I told him my problem and he did a blood test, which came back normal. So he said it’s probably nothing and that I’m probably fine. I hate going to the doctor so I was like “cool.” And left. A couple months ago I had a really bad one, and my BF wanted me to go to the ER but I refused. So the next day he convinced me to go to instacare. They did chest X-rays and an ekg. The Dr. there said that my left lung looked strange to her. She said that some people would look over it and give me a call, but no one ever did. She also told me to check in with me GP, so I did. This time he didn’t do any tests, just said the instacare Dr. was over reacting and that even though he didn’t see the X-ray, that I was fine. So again, I took him at his word

But I got the flu a few weeks ago, and went to instacare. Everything was normal but they left the heart monitor thing they put on your finger on the whole visit. Which I didn’t really think anything of, I thought they just forgot about it. 
But at the end the Dr. looked at the thing on my finger and said “the whole time you have been here your heart rate has risen and fallen really fast.” And she wanted me to do another ekg, and said my heart rate was really fast during it. She asked me if I was pregnant, which I said no. She said that I might have a blood clot in my lung. She wanted me to do a pregnancy test but I got really freaked out about the whole thing and told her I would take one at home. She told me to call her immediately if it was positive. I did But it was negative, so I just forgot about it. 

Also I’m unsure if it’s related, but my left arm has become super weak. I can’t lift it above my chest without losing feeling and it hurts constantly.

Anyways, I don’t want to pay to go back to my doctor again just for him to tell me I’m over reacting. I’ve been three times, two were for this problem and every time I go he says I’m fine or tries to put me on anti depressants I don’t want. Do you think this is serious?

29 female 5'6 167lbs.

So first I'd like to preface this by saying yes, I know I shouldn't have done it and yes, I'm an idiot.

So I've had this medium sized black lump under my skin for a long time. At least 3+ years. It's in an area I shave regularly so I always just sort of assumed it was an ingrown hair or something. Its pretty deep under the skin though so I never bothered it. And it didn't bother me. It didn't hurt or anything. Weeeellllll, a few nights ago I (again, I know I'm stupid) I noticed there was a little black mark on my lump and I thought maybe it was the hair pushing out so I decided to poke it and see if I could get whatever it was out. Well, it didn't work and I saw a little bit of cloudy liquid so I squeezed it. And a little more liquid came out. It still wasn't hurting. I squeezed a little more and at this point I decided it wasn't worth causing more damage than necessary so I stopped. It felt fine for the rest of that night and the next day it was mildly sore and I just chalked that up to messing with it. Fast forward to today, and it's definitely way more swollen. The black lump is now kind of small and sunken in compared to the larger red lump that is now around it. 
I'm hoping I just irritated the hell out of it and it's just swollen from that. I have a doctor's appointment on the 6th of January and im hoping I can make it till then to have it looked at but I gotta be honest, I also don't want to get some sort of infection or wait too long and have something bad happen. 
I know I shouldn't have messed with it. It was stupid. I genuinely regret doing it 
My question is , should I go to an urgent care or is that an overkill? Or should I just wait till the 6th?

No drug or alcohol use

I had leg surgery recently and was hospitalized for a week. I was given Percocet and Dilaudid for pain during the week which I stopped taking within a week of surgery (I'm 16 days post-op). I have always had a slowly moving digestive system as long as I can remember. I poop a couple of times per week and it's not unusual for me to go two weeks without a bowel movement. My mother and sister are the same way (we have a rare blood type that lacks certain stomach enzymes for digesting meat iirc), and my doctors have always said that if I'm not in pain or discomfort it's fine. 

Since getting out of the hospital I've been working to get my fiber intake back up, and the bowel movements I've had at home have been kind of painful. There has been some bleeding when I wipe, not very much though. I have had to strain a good deal to have my last 3-4 bowel movements though. 

My problem is that in the last two days I've had some pain and discomfort in my perineum. I discovered a lump that feels round and smooth on the right anterior side of my perineum. It is not posterior and not a hemorrhoid. It is firm, not squishy, but also not hard like a rock - and feels as if it's beneath the fatty tissue of my perineum. It can very clearly be felt from both the right side of my vaginal opening as well as my perineum outside of that area, but again still anterior. It doesn't disappear when I lay down, is uncomfortable but not ""painful"" and can be pushed upward into my pelvic cavity just a bit, but comes back down again. When I turn from side to side it can clearly be felt, as if there's a golf ball in that area.

Sex: Male  
Height: 180 cm / 5'9""  
Weight: 107,25 kg / 236 lbs  
Race: Caucasian  
Location: Brazil  
Existing Issues: Chronic Depression (since 12) and Social Anxiety (since 17)

&amp;#x200B;

* My main complain is: I always feel hot. Always.
* I do not use any drugs (a few years ago I stopped taking my depression and anxiety meds because my psychiatrist, psychologist and me feel like I don't need them anymore, so, no meds also).
* I do not smoke or drink.
* I like to walk, about 30 to 90 minutes a day. On thursdays I go to the gym for 2 hours to do heavy exercising.
* Two to three liters of water a day, three to five on thursdays.
* My sleep routine is not the best... wake up between 4 and 8 am, go to sleep around 9 am, wake up at 11 am, go to sleep around 3 pm, wake up at 4 pm. Go to sleep between 3 and 6 am. With a total between 4 to 6 hours of sleep a day. (I don't feel tired and I get some pretty nice dreams tho)
* My diet is pretty balanced, a bit of rice, beans, some veggies and sometimes meat (it's getting expensive around here). I don't eat breakfast, but I have lunch, two snacks in the evening, and dinner.
* I am not a fan of ""junk food"", like candy or fast food.
* My father is overweight, my mother is obese 1 bordering 2, my brother is at most a bit chubby. (am currently living with my mother and brother)
* All of my blood tests results seem healthy. (last time I did them was about 6 months ago)

About me always feeling hot...  
I don't know when it started, I remember starting to feel weak on summer when I was about 19. But as time goes on, it only seems to worsen.  
The average temperature on where I live seems to be between 20ºC (68ºF) to 25ºC (77ºF). For most people I know, this is comfortable, for me it's torture.  
My window is always open, my table fan is always on, I can't wear anything else other than t-shirts and shorts.  
It's not that I feel ""oh, wow, it's hot huh..."", it's more like I'm always on the verge of a heatstroke. But the thermometer always show 37ºC (98.6ºF)  
I remember when it was winter here around mid july, I had to leave 5 in the morning, it was 5ºC (41ºF), my hair was wet, really windy, and all I had on was a shirt, t-shirt and jeans, the shirt which I had to remove later.  
When it's a bit cold (between 10ºC and 15ºC) I get really hyped up and can get a lot of stuff done. When it's hot (anything above 20ºC) I feel extremely sluggish, and when it hits 30ºC, I honestly can't do anything, moving my body becomes a hassle and simple things (like taking a shower or going grocery shopping) makes me either have to rest every 5 minutes or makes me collapse.  
I don't seem to sweat as much as expected from the heat I seem to feel.  
My weight also hasn't changed in the last 7 years, doesn't matter how much of a lazy couch potato or healthy crossfitter I try to be.

*ps. I am sorry if this only seemed like a rant, but I don't know how to explain exactly how I feel.*  
*pss. I am sorry for any grammar mistakes, haven't been able to practive my english as much.*

I will try to answer any questions and update any useful info requested.

Patient Response: I am sorry. Just overexagerating about the tests. I'll edit. I meant that they were all on the expected average margin (I don't know the exact term)."	Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient’s persistent feeling of excessive heat despite normal lab results?	A chronic, undetected infection causing ongoing fever-like symptoms	An undiagnosed medication side effect from past antidepressant use	A subclinical form of hyperthyroidism that requires further evaluation	Ordinary variation in temperature perception with no underlying cause	C
True	t_f9w0oj2-0	"I think my wife is having a psychotic episode

This started about 2 nights ago. 

She came home from work at night and seemed distraught over a customer at the end of her shift, a man cane in and gave her a real hard time over some meatballs for his sub. She did what she was supposed to, and that was that. She seemed shaken by it, kinda on the verge of breaking down.

Time jump, Yesterday she picked me up from work to take me to an appointment and she's talking very spasticly. Fast speech. Almost constant I would say. She would curse a lot and mutter stuff to herself. We get back home and She goes to work then comes home. She had a similar night evidently and she's got this same shaken tone. She talks constantly, and switches from elated speech and moods to where it looks like she's about to cry. Throughout this time period and in the car from earlier she would say things that were very off-the-wall. For example, at the house she randomly asked me if I remembered. I asked her what, and she explained when I spoke to her about ""the war and the black opps"" that apparently happened minutes prior that I certainly didnt speak on. 

Another example is she said she was glad our baby son had pants. I responded with ""oh yeah?"" And she explained he had pants like hers that go up and down and up and down. Very odd stuff like that occasionally. 

She has also talked about being depressed and wanting to kill herself but made it a point she wasnt going to do anything. 

Later that night she spent about an hour or so having an emotional conversation about how sorry she was for certain events in our past, and how she's messed up and sees a difference in my attitude because of her actions. 

Today she's been doing fairly similar stuff, sometimes it's hard to understand what she's talking about when she explains something to me. 

As of right now I am at a family members house with my son. I begged her to check herself in tonight. I'm contemplating letting her mother know who is aware of her acting off lately. 

She doesn't have a history that I know of of acting anything like this. Sometimes when she's stressed she can exaggerate a situation and get overly mad about it, becoming very emotional and almost hyperventilating but nothing much more than that. She has told me she's been depressed before.

EDIT 3: I'm going to save some details, but my wife WAS on stimulants. From what the history of the past week, and some prior depression, I think it may have made it worse. She told me she it was only a bump. Now, I can vouch for a bump being insane, but she thinks maybe it was laced which is a possibility. 

Thank you to everyone who shared concerns and all who responded. I appreciate the help so much, and am so grateful. I'm going to take steps healthy that can hopefully prevent from this ever happening again, which I know mostly deals with our relationship. Thank you so much, reddit."

True	t_fa7fl7n-0	"Urologist question? Male infertility....

Primary complaint: My husband and I have been trying to conceive for over a year now with no success. In October, my husband had a semen analysis which came back as having zero sperm found. 

History: my husband was born with undescended testicles (unfortunately, we do not know if it was only 1 or both were undescended; my mother in law says she doesn’t remember, and the hospital doesn’t have records that far back). He is 26 years old. This was corrected with orchiopexy “around 1 year of age” (again, his mother does not remember exact age of correction). 

Husband does not smoke or drink. He is 135 lbs, 5’8. 

We can’t see a urologist or an endocrinologist until January, so I’m sure we will know more then, but I’m looking for any insight until then from anyone willing to read this post. These were my husband’s recent bloodwork results:

Testosterone - 3.17 ng/mL

Cortisol - 5.8 ug/dL

DHEA-SO4 - 218 ug/dL

TSH - 1.50 uIU/mL

Prolactin - 15.1 ng/mL

FSH - 12.3 mIU/mL

LH - 7.8 mIU/mL

We were told by our PCP that the only one of these results that was out of range is the prolactin, which may suggest a pituitary growth. I’m looking for other medical opinions, however. 

Does this seem like an mTESE would be a good option for us? Would Clomid potentially help?"	"Doctor Question: what's his entire semen analysis look like? can you post all of the report?
Patient Response: It says:

Appearance - opalescent white

Liquefaction - complete upon receipt by laboratory

*We collected sample at home, then brought to lab within 1 hour*

Volume - 2.5 mL

Sperm concentration - 0 M/mL

Total sperm / ejaculate - 0 M/ejaculate

Viscosity - Normal

pH - 8.2

Doctor Question: Any personal or family history of cystic fibrosis?
Patient Response: No, nothing like that in his family. His siblings and parents and grandparents are all relatively healthy overall."	Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to evaluate the feasibility of testicular sperm extraction (mTESE) in this patient with a history of cryptorchidism and azoospermia?	Start Clomiphene citrate (Clomid) to see if sperm production improves before any procedure	Proceed directly with microscopic testicular sperm extraction (mTESE)	Obtain genetic testing (e.g., Y-chromosome microdeletion analysis) prior to any surgical approach	Perform immediate pituitary MRI to rule out a large pituitary adenoma	C

True	t_fap4g6j-0	"It’s been two days since I’ve been to the clinic, but I’m getting worse.

I’m 19M, weighing in at 175lb and 5’9. With that out of the way, six days ago I went to the mall to see Christmas decorations and to look for presents for my younger cousins. Now, I don’t go out much, and I also have a phobia of germs. As a result, for the past four to five years, I usually only get sick once a year, if at all. The reason I’m bringing this up is because I thought it worth noting that perhaps my immune system isn’t very strong. I don’t know whether or not this is relevant, but I thought it worth noting based on the title of the thread. Anyways, since my cousins are eight and five, I went into a lot of toy stores. I bring this up because kids are nasty. By that, I mean they are always exposed to illnesses and don’t wash their hands before touching things. I don’t hate kids! It’s worth noting  I hadn’t yet gotten my flu shot, but I wasn’t all that concerned, as when I’m in public, I keep my hands away from my face when they aren’t clean, always wash my hands before I eat anything, and even open doors with my shirt covering my hand.
I left after a few hours. The following evening, my throat was ever so slightly sore. That’s a big red flag for me, but I went to bed and hoped it wasn’t going to be brutal. I woke up the next morning with a hellish pain in my throat. It hurt to swallow. It hurt to drink. It hurt. Period. My ears were popping and aching as well. I went to assess the damage and noticed white blotches behind my uvula, which seemed off. After a few hours and two Ibuprofen, the throat pain was pretty minimal, though my ears were still popping. Later that evening, I developed a cough, which only got worse as the night went on. All this combined with me coughing up phlegm, I decided to go to a walk in clinic the following day if I remained this way. I woke up in the morning, and I actually felt quite a bit better. I was still coughing up phlegm, and my cough was now a constant symptom, but my throat felt pretty okay. Nonetheless, I went to the clinic that evening. I explained my symptoms, and requested a strep test, which they obliged. The test came back negative, and the doctor said apart from my ears having some fluid in them, it seemed like a normal viral infection. Since I didn’t have a fever, headaches or chills, I also got my flu shot while I was there. Truthfully, I still wasn’t entirely convinced by the strep test, as I recall having strep when I was younger that only showed itself in a bacteria culture a few days after I went to the doctor and had the quick strep test come back negative. I figured, as a walk in clinic, they might not have been prepared to do a bacteria culture, so I didn’t say anything. I was told to come back if my ears got worse, and that was that. The next day (yesterday), I woke up and I was worse. My throat hurt again, I was awfully congested, my ears ached, and my cough was even more aggressive. I took Ibuprofen and it didn’t help. I ended up canceling my plans, went back to sleep for a few hours, and when I woke up, I felt considerably better. Not good, but better. My symptoms were just less aggressive. I wasn’t completely alarmed by this because I figured maybe it would just get worse before it gets better. Went about my day, and went to bed. Finally, we’re at today. I wake up, and my throat felt even worse. My nose was stuffed, I was congested, my ears hurt, and I had a splitting headache. I took some Ibuprofen and went back to sleep. That was a few hours ago, and as I write this, I’ve still got that splitting headache. My ears still ache. My throat doesn’t hurt as bad, but it still hurts. I know I’m definitively worse than I was yesterday. I won’t be able to get to the clinic today, but this is still alarming for me considering my past experiences getting sick. What should I do? I can’t get to the clinic, meaning my only option would be to call 911. I think that’s probably a bit too drastic, but that’s the only way I’d be able to seek medical help until tomorrow. I’m sure I can ride this out until tomorrow, but my throat looks inflamed and those white blotches are still there. Is it safe to wait until tomorrow, or should I get medical help ASAP before this potentially turns into something serious?

Thanks for taking the time to read this lengthy post."	"Doctor Question: You don’t mention fevers other than initially not having one, have you been checking your temp?
Patient Response: At no point in the last six days have I had a fever.

Patient Response: In regards to having mono, I’ve never had it. At least, not since I was old enough to remember, which would be around three."	Which of the following is the most appropriate next step for this patient who is worried about whether to seek immediate medical help?	Begin antibiotic therapy immediately for suspected strep throat	Call 911 and seek emergency room care right away	Continue supportive measures and plan to revisit the clinic if symptoms worsen or persist	Obtain urgent imaging tests to rule out serious complications	C
True	t_faraahz-0	"Nausea every time I eat, no matter what I eat

Nausea every time I eat, no matter what I eat

This first started in 2017 when I returned to the US after living in South America for about a year. I hated eating because it made me nauseous. But not like “I’m going to throw up” nauseous, but just supremely uncomfortable. And it’s a very distinct sensation I’ve only experienced with whatever this is that’s happening to me. It’s like nausea but... in my throat? Like right behind my clavicle region. I honestly thought I contracted a worm or something my last few days in South America, but being a genius and never went to a physician about it.

Well after about 6 months of that I started eating vegetarian and somehow that fixed it for me. I know longer had that sensation (And never found any evidence of worms). Fast forward to the last 2 months and it has started back up (admittedly I stopped eating vegetarian for about a year), but now even when I try to eat vegetarian habitually I still feel the horribly uncomfortable sensation. It’s almost advanced, to the point that drinking water aggravates it. But other times, I’ll be really nauseous and when I finally force myself to eat, it goes away. Sometimes I eat and nothing is wrong. 

I think I will start a log of what I eat and how I feel. Maybe that would help if it’s something in my diet. 

My sister once described being nauseous but “in her throat” which is the only time I’ve heard anyone else be able to relate to the feeling, but neither of my parents. However, she never related anything as irritating as what I am experiencing. My other sister has issues with her gall bladder, but the nausea this causes her when she eats the wrong foods often ends up with her vomiting. I have never done so with my... whatever it is. 

Any insights?? I just want to know how I can alleviate this horror

Edit: and I don’t know if it matters but I’m not into alcohol, tobacco, drugs.... really anything. Pretty vanilla. I’m a 22M and I wouldn’t say I’m real overweight, but I might be a lil chubs. Although, I’m still in good physical condition mostly (meaning I can run an 8 minute mile without struggling very much). 6’1” ~205 lbs, I’m on whatever generic brand of Zoloft (100mg daily) for depression.

True	t_fb0chpm-0	"Recurring fevers - exact same symptoms every few weeks or months, and no one ever gets sick from me. After having bloodwork done while sick, it’s come to light that my CRP level spiked to 49.9, and then back down to 0.77 when I’m healthy.

Hello everyone,

I’m sorry for the long title, I just wanted to get as much info in as I could. My name is Aaron, I’m a 24 year old male, and I live in Canada. 

For as far back as I can remember, I’ve been sick what I felt has been way more often than any of my friends. I didn’t realize at the time, but every single time I’ve been sick (aside from maybe the odd cold?) has been the EXACT SAME symptoms - this includes a fever of typically 38.9, a very sore throat, congestion, and a cough.

Initially, my mom and I believed I was constantly getting strep throat over and over again, so I would be treated as if it was and it would eventually go away. Like I said I don’t have a ton of memory on everything back then because I didn’t think anything of it at the time.

Then, we come to the last few years. I started to notice the pattern about 2 years ago when I first met my girlfriend. I got extremely sick like I usually do on New Years, and it lasted a couple of weeks like it usually does - but about 3 weeks later, I got sick again. Same symptoms. Fast forward to February, about a month later, I’m sick again with the same symptoms. March, about a month later again - same symptoms. April, about 3 weeks later, I’m sick again with the same symptoms as always.

It was around this time that my mom and I noticed that nobody ever gets sick from me. I’m never, ever contagious - it almost seems like my body’s reaction to something rather than an illness. 

This pattern continued for about a year, up until last New Years when I got sick again. I finally had enough and I decided to go to a walk in and explain my situation. I met a doctor who finally was willing to look into what this could be, rather than just marking it off as a cold or strep throat. He gave me some forms to get bloodwork done once when I was healthy, and again when I was sick. 

I waited until I was sick to get my bloodwork done, but, to my surprise, I didn’t get sick this year until about 9 months later. Come October, sure enough i was sick with the same symptoms as always. I got my bloodwork done while I was sick, and to my surprise all of my results came back normal EXCEPT - I had a CRP level of 49.9. I’m lucky enough to be dating and living with my girlfriend who is a Registered Nurse, and she explained to me that a high CRP level indicates some sort of swelling in the body, and could really be chalked up to anything.

So, when I was healthy, I went back to get my blood work done. After getting it done, I went back into the same walk in clinic and spoke with the doctor who was willing to look into what it could be.

He explained to me that my CRP had spiked to 49.9 while I was sick, and had fallen back down to 0.77 while I was healthy. He said that usually with something like a cold or the flu, you could expect to see CRP levels of 13 or so due to a cough or a sore throat causing some swelling - but he said because it spiked to high, he thinks we could be on the right track and it could be something else.

One thing we’re looking into is something called Periodic Fever Syndrome. This is usually (rarely) found in children, and typically doesn’t last until adulthood. Some adults however can even more rarely be diagnosed with this.

With all of that being said, that brings me to today. I was sick about a month ago, and surprise surprise I’m sick again. Last night my fever started out at around 37.9 when I noticed it, and I woke up about an hour and a half ago with a fever of 38.8 (Celsius of course). 

I’m going to wait a few days, and when whatever this is is at its peak, I’m going to get bloodwork again to see if my CRP spikes back up again. If it does, the doctor said he will most likely try to treat it as if it’s Periodic Fever Syndrome:

The reason I’m writing in is to see if anyone else has something like this, or if any doctors have any opinions or insight they would be willing to share. 

I’m so tired of being constantly sick. It’s effected many jobs as I have to call in sick, it effects my day to day and general happiness, and I just want it to stop.

True	t_fbps956-0	"[22M] Doctor prescribed 3 rounds of antibiotics in under 2 months. Should I be concerned?

A couple months back I started having a sore throat lower down than what you would typically get from a cold. After visiting my doctor he said it’s inflamed and is likely an infection. He prescribed be antibiotics for 7 days. They seemed to work but then near the end of the prescription the pain began coming back. After a long waiting period to have another appointment I got in. At this point he prescribed me another round of antibiotics that stay in my system longer after taking the last dose (5 doses, 9 days in my system). They seemed once again to help but the sore throat has slowly coming back. After my third visit (today) I was hoping for a referral or tests. Something to look further into the cause. But instead he prescribed YET ANOTHER 10 Days of antibiotics saying he’ll refer me if after the appointment 10 days from now it appears to still be inflamed. Should I be concerned about taking this many antibiotics? That’s 3 rounds in less than 2 months. This most recent prescription is 30 capsules of amoxicillin.

29F white. Height is 5’4 roughly 140 lbs.
Medications: venlafaxine 150mg (since 2013). Trazodone 50mg at night as needed, hydroxyzine 25mg up to 3 times a day as needed, lamotrigine 100mg (all 4 started within the last 2 months). Occasional probiotic,Tylenol, and ibuprofen. 
Medical issues: (other than mental health) vitamin B deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, both started in October. I was diagnosed with Covid mid October that caused pneumonia in bottom of lungs and spread up to the top of right lung. Finally got over the Covid symptoms a couple of weeks ago but I still struggle with heart problems. When I was in the ER in November for trouble breathing and chest pain the doctor was more concerned with my heart and tachycardia I had while laying down and sitting up and standing. Ekg showed right atrial enlargement but I understand that is usually caused by stress, especially during a virus (I think). Sometimes high blood pressure. Also for years had heart palpitations or skipped heart beats once a week but the last month it happens multiple times a week or day (probably stress related). They referred me to a cardiologist which I go to tomorrow. 
No drugs or cigarettes, however I do binge drink wine almost every night which is a problem I’m working on. 
In early October I overdosed on Tylenol, NyQuil, and Benadryl in a suicide attempt and had to be taken to the hospital. I was there for days. No lasting issues that I’m aware of or liver damage. 
Other than all of that, maybe a little before or when I got Covid in October is when the dark colored stool started. It wasn’t every day, but when it wasn’t a super dark green it was very dark brown. Now it is almost every day. It’s always a dark green almost black color. Google of course only pulls up that it’s normal after eating lots of greens, which has happened to me before, but it’s not the same. Even if I don’t eat vegetables, no matter what I eat, it comes out this color. Is this something I should be concerned about? Maybe one of the medications I’m on somehow cause this?

So on the first of December I gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl. She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because ‘that’s how babies are designed ‘ , but they didn’t see it , they didn’t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things.
Nevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn’t of helped her.

Fast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.

True	t_gh81nvw-0	"Not sure when to go to ER? New numbness and fecal incontinence.

I'm 30F, about 180lbs, almost 6"", Caucasian, and living in North America. 

In terms of medical conditions, I have a confirmed pituitary adenoma and lupus (probable kidney involvement - waiting biopsy). 

Since the summer, I've been experiencing bizarre neurological symptoms (memory loss, concentration issues, tingling of various body parts, and shooting pain down my spine which my GP says is probably l'hermitte's sign). I've also been diagnosed with new central sleep apnea and am being treated, which is helping! And have a weird pressure headache at the back of my head. 

I've been referred to a neurologist, but it's a slow process in my country (sometimes). I had a brain and cervical spine MRI a few days ago, but I cannot access the report yet.

I'm writing here because something new developed this weekend and I'm not sure where I should turn. My GP is great but on holidays until the new year. 

My groin and a few fingers have become numb. In fact, I accidentally dropped hot candle wax on my pinky and couldn't feel the heat. Additionally, this is TMI, but also been having some mild fecal incontinence and I don't even realize it until I go to the bathroom. Both of these are new. All my other symptoms are the same and not worse.

I'm not sure when I should go to emergency? Or if this can wait until my GP is in.

True	t_gh8g3ca-0	"Not sure when to go to ER? New numbness and fecal incontinence.

I'm 30F, about 180lbs, almost 6"", Caucasian, and living in North America. 

In terms of medical conditions, I have a confirmed pituitary adenoma and lupus (probable kidney involvement - waiting biopsy). 

Since the summer, I've been experiencing bizarre neurological symptoms (memory loss, concentration issues, tingling of various body parts, and shooting pain down my spine which my GP says is probably l'hermitte's sign). I've also been diagnosed with new central sleep apnea and am being treated, which is helping! And have a weird pressure headache at the back of my head. 

I've been referred to a neurologist, but it's a slow process in my country (sometimes). I had a brain and cervical spine MRI a few days ago, but I cannot access the report yet.

I'm writing here because something new developed this weekend and I'm not sure where I should turn. My GP is great but on holidays until the new year. 

My groin and a few fingers have become numb. In fact, I accidentally dropped hot candle wax on my pinky and couldn't feel the heat.

True	t_ghjzw0z-0	"Frustrated nurse with weird fecal vomiting case

I'm a nurse in a group home for adults with severe multiple handicaps (Netherlands) and we are often not taken serious by doctors. For the past few days one of my residents (male, 66) has been very upset, hitting everyone who comes close to him (he only ever does this when he is very uncomfortable but it has been exteme and all our interventions do nothing, ie; painkillers, change of position, less stimuli or more). He has **bloating in his stomach**, it sounds hollow when you knock on his upper right part of his abdomen. Now keep in mind, this man's body is pretty malformed, we have no idea what his skeleton looks like or how his organs are situated. He has had sennosides, a lot of macrogol and received enemas every other day, his defecation pattern was normal (his **defecation is always water thin** because of laxatives and tube feedings). His **temperature wasn't high**  **(37,1 C/98,78 F).**

Tonight he was **extremely upset, feces came out of his J-tube** (he's had a J-tube for years and his intestine barely do anything anymore) and **out of his mouth.** We were sure he had an **ileus**. He was sent to the ER and was sent right back; CTscan didn't show any obstipation, his urine levels were normal and his lungs looked normal as well. They just sent him home... The doctor says he thinks it's a stomach virus.

Now I'm pretty young, not very experienced, but what kind of stomach virus could ever have anyone fecal vomit? I absolutely do not believe this.

Any help? Has anyone seen something as strange as this before?

Edit: made improtant things bold + minor spelling corrections

Edit 31/12/2020: This morning my colleagues called our doctor again for any help, since the hospital didn't provide us with anything else. The man had the audacity to prescribe **2x 500mg paractamol** and told us to **stop giving the resident Diclofenac because it would hurt his stomach more**... I cannot explain how angry I was. On top of that, he told us to only call him if the resident got a fever.

So my shift started, I discussed the situation with a fellow colleague who was equally as angry as I was (the resident was still extremely upset, hitting everything around him, quick surface breathing, we could easily see he was in pain. Family had arrived at that point and said the same. Once family says there;s something bad going on, it's in our best interest to absolutely believe them). We called the doctor again, after a few hours an assistant called back telling us the doctor prescribed **oxycodon** (5mg... but it's something to start with). He also allowed us to **decrease the tube feedings**; still the same speed, just 50% water 50% peptisorb. 
Later in the afternoon and evening he slept, slept and slept. He was calm, I guess. The whole day after him being admitted to hospital, there weren't any feces around his mouth or in his tube. Colleagues have pointed out that they would've recognized the smell of fecal vomiting, and because his feces are so thin, it could've been something else. But then again, the man takes in nothing but white/yellow peptisorb. The colour of the liquid could potentionally point to **nexium** (? he does take this but has never had this color show up) or **old blood**, which is still a massive problem. We weren't able to send him back to the ER since there was nothing accute going on anymore. The doctor didn't want to send him in again because he cannot say what's wrong... 

**Extra information that I had missed:** He wasn't being tube fed the first few hours in hospital and seemed to calm down because of that, hence the change in his feeding pattern, yet he was still angry. 
In his medical history this has happened before, nothing was ever done but it always cleared up by itself after different tube feeding or antibiotics. 
He also has a **hernia diagfragmatica**, **reflux oesophagus** and when he was a young boy he had **stomach bleeding.**

**Thank you all for the comments and sweet words! I'm honestly at a loss of what to do and as many of you have said, only time will tell. I'm off for a few days now (not actually free, I also work at a different group, oops) so I can only hope he is still there after I come back. 
Colleagues have pointed out that because his anatomy is so different, perhaps it indeed is just a stomach virus that made him have feces in places it definetely shouldn't be.

True	t_hpttplp-0	"My significant other's health has sharply deteriorated and after months we have no idea what it is.

Hello. My (24F) boyfriend, Paul (29M), and I are fairly active. We go on road trips every year with our main stops being prime hiking spots. Paul is 5'7'' and 230 pounds. Due to his southeast asian/pacific genetics, his entire family is on the heavier side, but Paul is just as active as I am and eats well.

Recently, we have gone long distance. Paul returned to live with his parents due to the pandemic while I stayed where I was. I visited him in June 2021. At this point, Paul had few symptoms, but some new minor health issues. We went hiking around Lake Tahoe and Paul was a little more out of breath than usual. He hasn't needed to use his inhaler since he was a kid, and he had to use it on this trip. We attributed this to recent wildfires in the area and poor air quality.

However, Paul's health continued to sharply deteriorate. We went to Edinburgh, Scotland, in July. While hiking Arthur's Seat, Paul had to use his inhaler so many times he emptied it out. He could not get it refilled as we were out of the country. Until the end of the trip, Paul's breathing became more and more labored and he developed a persistent cough.

I did not visit Paul August-November 2021. We spoke on the phone and Skyped regularly. During this time, Paul would sometimes leave the call or mute for a few minutes. He'd come back and apologize, saying he'd had to cough pretty violently and didn't want me to hear. I was concerned. I overheard one wracking, moaning coughing session and knew it was not just asthma or an irritated throat. By October 2021, the air quality in his area had greatly improved.

I persuaded Paul to visit his general practitioner. His GP dismissed all of his concerns and cited Paul's being fat and asthmatic as the source of his issues, and that the issues would disappear with rest and exercise. I had to fight doctors for years to get them to take my chronic pelvic pain seriously, and was finally diagnosed with an ovarian cyst that was 8mm long and about to burst, so I have experience with self advocacy in the medical space. I helped Paul see new doctors.

In mid-October 2021, Paul developed abdominal edema. Paul's feet, legs, and lower stomach were swelling up like crazy. He gained 40 pounds. He could barely move at all, even to go to the bathroom. He couldn't sleep lying down without suffocating, which only worsened his exhaustion. He went to the doctor again and was prescribed diuretics. The diuretics helped with the swelling and extra weight and within 2 weeks he was back to his regular weight, but the coughing and weakness persisted.

About a month after regularly taking diuretics (November), Paul started feeling intense nausea on a weekly basis. This nausea would prompt coughing fits. Paul couldn't eat or focus while nauseated. Our calls became more and more infrequent as Paul's nausea and headaches grew. He told me sometimes the nausea would get so bad that he would vomit. There were no patterns to the vomiting--it didn't happen at a certain time of day or after meals. Sometimes it was foamy. He got a CT scan to look at his gall bladder and all results were within normal ranges. Blood tests, including labs for liver function, all came back normal. His doctor referred him to a gastroenterologist for more testing, but due to increases in COVID-19 cases, they haven't even processed his file, let alone scheduled appointments, which would be months out. A nurse anticipated he wouldn't be able to go in until February 2022, but at his rate of decline, this has me concerned for his mental wellbeing and life quality.

This week, in late December 2021, I visited him and his family for Christmas. I had heard from Paul about his issues and was following closely with his medical updates, but seeing it firsthand was another thing altogether. I have never seen human suffering and sickness like this up close or cared for another human being in such an intimate way.

Every single day, he has intense coughing fits and bouts of nausea where he makes vocalizations and gags, usually every few hours. At least once a day, these coughing fits are so bad that he spends 5-30 minutes vomiting in the sink. The vomiting has increased drastically. After this, the nausea alleviates, but Paul feels exhausted and has migraines. He barely eats. He barely sleeps.

Today, he had three different nausea/coughing bouts that induced vomiting. One developed rapidly and he threw up in a restaurant bathroom. The last one, which just happened this evening as of writing this post, also caught him by surprise, and he vomited in the kitchen sink. The vomiting was so physically taxing that his nose bled profusely and he lost control of his bowels and peed himself. He was not strong enough to make it down the hall to the bathroom. Eventually, I assisted him into the shower. I am writing this before bed, and he is still coughing, and has a migraine. He hasn't gotten up from where he sat after taking the shower.

I would appreciate any medical advice about what might be causing what Paul is going through, as well as tips for how to navigate the medical system to ensure this gets treated in the best way possible. I would like to reiterate that while neither of us are marathon running body builders, Paul (before all of this) was physically active and monitored his eating habits. He was also mentally active and had returned to school to pursue a degree in a new field. We both have families that are reasonably well off and are good support systems.

Paul is one tough puppy, and reassures me that it ""isn't so bad,"" but after seeing it firsthand, I know this is not something that can continue the way it is. I am extremely worried, and caring for him is beginning to wear on me mentally. Sometimes I feel sympathy nausea when I hear the noises he makes in the bathroom.

Please help in any way possible. I appreciate any and every tip, and can provide additional information if needed. Thank you very much.

UPDATE 12/26:

We went to the ER at 4 AM right after Christmas. Luckily, it was almost completely empty. I was not allowed to go back with him, so for the entire five hours I was sitting in the waiting room, I was only ever accompanied by one or two other people at a time.

Paul's shortness of breath, fatigue, and wracking coughs got him seen quickly. He texted me updates as things progressed. He got every test I wrote down from these comments--BNP test, pulmonary work, chest x rays, GI work. An echocardigram is scheduled for next week.

They found out right away that Paul's BNP results were seven times higher than usual. They said this was indicative of heart failure. They also tested Paul for COVID 19. He tested negative, but did test indicating he had some kind of viral illness.

Paul's doctor concluded that he was suffering from chronic RSV that was made worse by poor genetics, asthma, and obesity. Paul did confirm he had what felt like a respiratory illness in Scotland in June, then after going to a wedding in October, then this week when he got severely ill and we found out his mother had a cold.

There is no cure for RSV, but a vaccine has reached human trials. The only things Paul can do to alleviate his own suffering and avoid a heart attack is to make significant lifestyle changes and live like an immunocompromised person. I believe in his ability to achieve the former, but the latter is more difficult because of his emotionally overattached mother who brings the entire extended family out for lunches, movie nights, shopping, etc. several times a week. I'm concerned she won't take it seriously or will be in denial to avoid feeling responsible and will therefore continue to expose Paul to colds that could kill him.

Paul is currently resting. He was given medication for his nausea and a new inhaler. He is doing better but still coughing. We have already started on his new food regimen. I am hoping for the best, but the pandemic has proved that people rarely take precautions for others' goodwill. Thank you for all your support.

Hey reddit! I(21F) just got diagnosed with ILD, Lung fibriosis in specific. I have been doing all the research i can but there isn’t extensive information. I do smoke weed and vape pretty regularly and am around 93 lbs if that helps anything.

According to my dr we caught it early and my lungs are only 14-15% damaged. He did say this can be fully reversed but everywhere i’ve looked says otherwise. im not sure what to believe so my question is: can this be reversed since it caught on early? 

I’ve also been reading the lifespan of this disease is 3-5 years maybe longer but you can definitely die a premature death. I’m so not ready to accept this so if any doctors can provide any insight please let me know."	"Doctor Question: Was it an ILD specialist who diagnosed you, a general pulmonologist, or a general physician not specializing in pulmonary?
Patient Response: None

Doctor Question: How exactly were you diagnosed (what kind of doctor, what kind of imaging, any biopsy, etc)?
Patient Response: Also, not sure if this is of any help but the exact statement on my HRCT is: “Few areas of Fibriosis are noted involving bilateral lungs”

Doctor Question: What are the next steps from this doctor?
Patient Response: None"	Which of the following statements best aligns with the discussion about mild lung fibrosis in the patient’s post, including its potential reversibility and recommended next steps?	Full reversal of lung fibrosis is guaranteed if it is only 14-15% damage and the patient is otherwise healthy, so further specialist consultations are unnecessary.	The patient’s current fibrotic changes indicate a severe end-stage disease, and no treatments can improve lung function or prognosis.	While full reversal may not be commonly achieved, consulting an ILD specialist for further evaluation can help optimize management and potentially slow or stabilize disease progression.	Pulmonary rehabilitation is not effective for mild pulmonary fibrosis, so the patient should only focus on lifestyle changes instead of specialist input.	C

The 2 main medicines i’ve been prescribed are symbicort turbuhaler and pulmofib (Pirfenidone). I am supposed to take the second one for 6 months and he told me it will break the fibriosis down.

Based on the patient's discussion with her doctor, which statement is most accurate about the potential outcomes and recommended management steps for mild fibrotic lung changes in ILD?	Early ILD scarring is always fully reversible within a few weeks with medication	ILD scarring can never be reversed at all, so there’s no benefit from medication	When caught early, fibrotic changes may be partially improved with medication and lifestyle modifications	Any ILD scarring inevitably leads to a short life expectancy of under five years	C

Depression rarely affects physically healthy people, and if it does, it goes away on its own within a day or two.	Physical health changes are completely unrelated to mood, so addressing depression generally has no impact on physical symptoms.	Even healthy individuals can experience marked physical changes from depression, and improvement may take weeks to months with proper treatment.	Having normal blood test results essentially rules out depression, so another physical cause should be the primary focus.	C

Duration: 6 months
Area: Neck

This happened for the first time two years ago where I had issues initiating swallowing food but it went away on its own after 2 weeks. Then, last year in November it came back and it's lasted all the way to now, end of April. I think it's slowly getting worse but I can't really tell. It takes me 40 minutes to finish a meal that takes a normal person maybe 7 minutes to finish.

Mostly I feel that the right side of my throat is very tight and food only goes through the left side. This in turn generated a fear of choking so I'm chewing my food for ever. Even liquids I can feel them distinctly go through the left side but without issues. Food was never stuck in my throat, never made me cough or went the wrong way. Just feels like a tighter passage.

Now, I did see multiple doctors and now I'm seeing a hospital doctor. In all they performed 1 nasal endoscopy, 1 full mouth endoscopy all the way to the duodenum, 3 ultrasounds and 1 MRI of the head &amp; neck. They found nothing except irritation in my throat which they thought was caused by gastric acid. It's now two months I've been taking Dexilant 60mg with no improvement, maybe the contrary. I also changed my diet - not that I ever ate fast food - but I added some Apple Cider Vinegar before meals, Kefir after meals, frying eggs with coconut oil, etc.  Even so, it's really hard to maintain my weight and not go insane with this issue.

True	t_ctofebn-0	"Embarrassing question...

Hi there, I am a 19 year old boy. My friend has the HIV Virus, and I have a few questions as I am a little worried. 

We have hugged, shared a drink and cigarette on numerous occasions, we have shared a hot tub, and other things such as this that friends do. Nothing sexual. 

I am however a little anxious. Tonight we were in the hot tub together with some other friends and I have a small spot on my chest that I have popped and as such have a small cut. The hot tub is well maintained and kept to the correct levels of chlorine, pH, etc. I also have a small fissure on my anus due to prior constipation. Do I have cause to be concerned?

Another issue is that I asked him to get me a beer whilst he was out (I normally drink this beer with lime) and when he gave it to me I was already a bit anxious due to the parts aforementioned. I tried it and it tasted off, but when I gave it to my friends they smelled it and it smelled fine, but one of my friends thought it tasted odd such as it had lemonade in it or something. I took two sips in total from the drink but I didn't swallow it, instead spitting it out and throwing the drink out. 

It smelled fine but tasted a bit off. My friends don't think that the mentioned friend would be the type to mess with a drink, and he promised me that he didn't do anything to it. Am I worrying about something for no reason? Or should I be concerned? Do I need to be tested for the HIV virus? Or am I just being overly anxious? 

He has been a best friend of mine for a long time, and I often worry about this. This is the first time that I have mentioned it however to anyone. 

Do I need to be tested or anything? I don't know what I'm worried about him having done to my drink. Maybe urinated in it or something, but again, I think this is down to me just being anxious or silly - certainly if he did do anything to it, it would smell off, too? "	"Doctor Question: Also, do you really think he'd do that?
Patient Response: Thank you. And no, I don't really think he would do that. I suppose it's just my nervousness and anxiety."	Based on the patient’s concerns about hugging, sharing a hot tub with a small cut, and anxiety about a possibly tampered beverage, what is the most appropriate conclusion regarding HIV transmission risk?	The risk of contracting HIV from hugging or sharing drinks is high enough to justify immediate testing.	The small cut on the chest and anal fissure while in a chlorinated hot tub could significantly increase the transmission risk for HIV.	An unusual taste in the beer strongly suggests it was tampered with, making urgent HIV testing necessary.	Casual contact, properly maintained hot tubs, and minor cuts in this scenario pose no real risk for HIV transmission.	D

From what I understand, she starts to feel something in the left side of her throat, like something starts to swell up (she describes it as ""tightening"", but my husband suggested the word ""swelling"" and she agreed). The ""swelling"" sensation causes her to start to gag, and after she gags, she will start to choke and is unable to breathe. While she is having one of these episodes, she can sometimes get a gasping breath (Remember that episode of Game of Thrones where Theon was running away from Ramsay and he got knocked off his horse and got the wind knocked out of him, and he did that horrible gasping breath? That's exactly what it sounds like.) We had to call 911 for her about a month ago because she was unable to breathe for quite a long time. 

She is always hacking shit up, in her words it's stuff ""like glue"". She has seen doctors for everything, biopsies, X-rays, cameras down her throat, everything. They have been unable to find anything. They give her stuff for her sinuses, but it is quite clearly something much more serious than sinus issues.

A week ago I had a bad cold or maybe the flu. I could barely get out of bed, I had a horrible headache, I was sneezing like crazy and had a small light cough. Three days later, on Saturday, it was all gone. That is except for the cough. somehow, it got worse. It's now Wednesday and I still have it. It comes and goes and it's not so bad I can't do my work or anything. It's more so just annoying. Like hiccups almost. It hasn't gotten any worse or better. Also when I breath hard, I wheeze a little. Drinking non soda's like tea and water seem to help sooth it and help my breathing a little. Sitting up has a similar effect I think. Sometimes, like once or twice a day, it also feels like I have a little ""gunk"" stuck in my throat and I gotta do that weird throat thing to spit it up. The coming and going of it is frequent but I think it gets more frequent when I'm sitting and even worse when I'm laying down. It hasn't gotten to the point where I've had more than one or two coughing fits but it's still, as I said, really annoying.

True	t_drm17fp-0	"Smelling SO's bad breath but nobody else can?

For nearly a year my SO's breath has gotten worse and worse and it's ripping us apart. It's so bad it fills up any room they are in, it's nearly impossible to sleep next to them, I can smell it in the car if they have driven it that day. It's so bad today that even if they just walk into the same room as me it's faintly there from 10 feet away. I am unable to be intimate because of this, and I fear it's going to end our relationship.

They are diligent with brushing/flossing/mouthwash. They went to a GP in the spring that said he couldn't find anything wrong. We took a trip to the dentist and they said gums and teeth were OK, tongue seemed OK. My SO asked a few friends to smell their breath and nobody reported anything, although I'm not sure that's trustworthy (how awful would it be to tell your best friend their breath smelled extremely bad?) Tonsils have been removed, but no clear evidence of tonsil stones in the remaining tissue where they could grow. Had bloodwork done recently, not diabetes.

The only thing left seems to be to go to an ENT? 

My opinion is that it's stress related. My SO has anxiety attacks, and I think that couples with the fact they got a promotion earlier this year and they are under immense stress. We've been together for years and they never had bad breath before. The breath issue corresponds with the promotion on a timeline. 

The breath can fade in and out. It's slowly better on the weekend (usually) when they aren't thinking about work. Saturday night with friends and a beer and it seems to subside. Likewise, Monday night it's back full force. Same goes now leading up to the holidays. 

The other option seems to be that it's phantosmia on my part. Evidence to this could be that when this became an issue in the spring, I did ask one of my parents to smell for my SO's breath on a visit. They reported nothing, but during the visit the breath had faded nearly completely. This is also true for the aforementioned trip to the dentist. 

TL;DR: SO's breath smells so bad I can't be in the same room with them. SO cannot smell it, their friends say they can't smell it, and any time I try to get a neutral third party to detect it, it goes away to a level that's not going to be smelled by someone who isn't in kissing proximity.

Why are my triglycerides so low while everything else is so high. From what I've read, having an HDL/TRIG ratio of below 2 is very good?

Also, I thought total cholesterol was LDL + HDL + 1/5th of your Trig?

The HDL-to-triglyceride ratio alone is sufficient to evaluate cardiovascular risk, so other cholesterol values can be ignored.

They found nothing wrong at the ER but I obviously had a seizure but I do manual labor for work so that might be making it worse. I think this was seizure #6 and I have been told I have a seizure disorder, not epilepsy. Also I can't take NSIADs.

True	t_cwqnbzk-0	"36/F - Felt like UTI, clinic doc said no

I'm 36/F and have controlled hypothyroidism and occasional candidiasis.  I normally only take Synthroid 50 and Celexa 10 daily, along with Klonopin as needed.  I've recently finished two rounds of Amoxicillin and Norco for a tooth infection.

Symptoms began a couple of weeks ago with a feeling of irritation that I normally associate with UTI.  Water and cranberry pills didn't help and I'd begun to have frequent urination, so I went to urgent care over the weekend.  The doctor found no trace of a UTI or any other problem, but gave me medication for my tooth (more Amoxicillin), told me it might help the UTI, and if not he'd refer me to a urologist.

My condition worsened and I began drinking more water, taking cranberry pills, D-mannose and aloe juice throughout the day, while also adding a women's health probiotic.  Things began to clear up for me right before my period.  When my period went away, some symptoms seemed to return.

I currently have weird irritation after urination.  I seem to urinate a bit more than usual, but not as much as before my period.  Sitting for long periods of time makes my vulva/urethra feel uncomfortable.  It honestly feels like whatever I had isn't as bad in some ways and is worse in others.

I haven't been sexually active in a year and a half and have only masturbated once since the issue began.  I only stimulated my clitoris, but I feel it may have irritated the area further.

I am waiting on a call back from the gynecologist, but I'd love some opinions on what might be wrong and anything I can potentially do to minimize the annoying discomfort.

Thank you!

*Edit:*  I visited urgent care this morning, due to no free appointments at my PCP.  I was diagnosed with a UTI and given Cirpro.  Thanks for the help!"	"Doctor Question: Why not pursue that referral?
Patient Response: I didn't pursue it initially because the condition did slightly improve for a seven day period and I was a bit concerned about evasive procedures that could come with a urologist. I had a nasty experience with a specialist a couple of years ago, so I thought I'd see if probiotics and other natural supplements could help. That was definitely an error on my part."	Which of the following best describes the patient's main reason for not immediately pursuing the referral to a urologist recommended by her urgent care doctor?	She was not sure about the doctor’s competence.	She already had an appointment with her primary care physician.	She worried about invasive procedures due to a past negative experience.	She was advised by her dentist to wait until her tooth infection had completely cleared.	C

True	t_cwzadc8-0	"Cleaned up mercury thermometer spill, some of it still caught between tiles in floor. Should I be concerned?

* 22
* Male
* A little under Six Feet Tall.
* 155-ish lbs/70-ish Kg.
* Latinoamerican
* Not taking anything at the moment.

So last night, I was feeling kinda queasy and had a weird cough, so I decided to take my temperature with a mercury thermometer I had. After doing that, I accidentally dropped it and it broke on the tile floor. None of it got on me, and I spent the next 30-40 minutes cleaning it up (wearing latex gloves and avoiding any contact with the mercury if possible, mostly used ziploc bags and tissue paper, though I think some of it did touch my hands a couple times, after which I washed my hands with hot water and a ton of soap for about 3 to 4 minutes, about three times, don't have any rashes or anything on my hands). 

After I was done, I put all the things I used to clean up with on a small plastic bag and I put that in a larger trash bag, took it out and threw it in the landfill tub outside my apartment. After I got back, I noticed some tiny droplets were caught between the tiles, deep enough that I couldn't move them with anything I had. I've left the living room windows open all night (this happened roughly at 11:30 last night) to vent the room, and I checked this morning and the small droplets are still there, but look noticeably smaller. I slept in my bedroom with the door closed and have stayed away from the living room so far, mostly just going there a couple times to check if the droplets are still lodged between the tiles.

My question is, should I be worried about having inhaled or otherwise been exposed to dangerous amounts of mercury overnight? Should I be concerned about mercury poisoning?

And, most importantly, should I be concerned about the tiny droplets between the tiles? We're talking small enough that I only noticed them by shining a flashlight right on top of them."	"Doctor Question: Are you 100% sure it was a mercury thermometer?
Patient Response: Positive. I brought it with me from Chile when I came into the country in a small first aid pack I got from a pharmacy. We still use those there, I believe. Plus the liquid on the floor looked and acted like mercury. It was a shiny liquid that slid off most surfaces and congregated in blobs."	Which of the following is the best next step in addressing the small droplets of mercury still lodged between the floor tiles?	Vacuum the area thoroughly with a household vacuum cleaner.	Mop the floor using hot water and bleach to dissolve any remaining mercury.	Keep the area well ventilated, avoid vacuuming or sweeping, and follow local mercury spill guidance if necessary.	Ignore the droplets since they are too small to cause any harm, letting them evaporate on their own.	C
True	t_do14qap-0	"Tonsil Stones??

So for YEARS I’ve had chronic sore throat, sinus issues, ear aches, trouble breathing, etc. I’m not implying causality with the following scenario but I’m thinking it’s a possibility? Anyway, it’s never been so bad that I couldn’t just deal with it given the occasional day off to rest and recover. Well randomly tonight I was having a rough time. I looked at my throat and saw white spots. Naturally, I thought, “CRAP, strep!”.  Just so happens I was with someone who second guessed me and took a look for himself. He told me he’d had this issue and that it was tonsil stones. We proceeded to extract not one but NINE motherlovin’ nasty ass stones from my tonsils. And that’s just what we could catch on q-tips-not including the ones (larger than the ones we swabbed, probably 6-7 in number) I coughed/vomited up. Needless to say, I’m thoroughly grossed/freaked out. Hopefully I can now justify having my tonsils removed. Would this be enough to justify a tonsillectomy? I’m also wondering about the underlying cause. I am very meticulous with my oral hygiene and my diet. I am an otherwise very healthy, active 26 y/o female. I’m having a minor meltdown at 3 am. Haaaalp! "	"Doctor Question: Have you ever been to an ENT for your issues?
Patient Response: Thank you very much for the info. I will definitely be making an appointment with an ENT! I can deal with sore throats but these nasty little things are too much."	Which statement best addresses whether frequently occurring tonsil stones and chronic throat discomfort may justify a tonsillectomy for this patient?	A tonsillectomy is only considered for strep infections, so multiple stones alone would not be an indication.	If the patient experiences recurrent symptoms and significant discomfort, an ENT might recommend a tonsillectomy.	Regular saltwater gargles are always enough to prevent tonsil stones and make surgery unnecessary.	Tonsil stones are harmless and do not require any further assessment or treatment by a specialist.

False	t_doaax3b-0	"Question about broken right tibfib surgery

Hello, I am a 30 year old woman, I just had my first car accident ever on Saturday October the 7th thanks to someone running a stop sign. I ended up with a very badly broken leg, they said it was the tibfib, it was floppy and so very painful. Well, they didn't really take care of me at the hospital, I received no pain management until after I had surgery, but I am getting off topic. The surgeon came and told me he was putting a rod in the big one, the tibula, and not doing anything for the other one saying it will set itself right. After the surgery it didn't feel right while I was there. I was discharged 2 days later and it still doesn't feel right, it's kind of grindy feeling when I am setting my pillows up to prop my leg. A friend who had the same thing got a rod in both bones and said I should seek a second opinion. Is only one rod normal? 

Other stuff, I am 5'6"" at 215lbs, when I was discharged I was told absolutely no weight on my foot and was given a walker, which I hate. "	"Doctor Question: How far from surgery are you now?
Patient Response: The accident was October 7th, presumably you just had surgery and were discharged today or yesterday.

Doctor Question: I'm sure the nurse or doc would have given you instructions on how to take care of and clean your leg at home?
Patient Response: No, they gave me 3 page discharge packet and it most covered what I had done and my medication.

Doctor Question: If it's tight to the point of cutting off circulation or extreme discomfort you should loosen it of course....
Patient Response: None"	Which statement best reflects the typical management of a tib-fib fracture when only the tibia is surgically stabilized with a rod?	It is recommended to place rods in both the tibia and fibula for every tib-fib fracture.	A single rod in the tibia is usually inadequate, so further surgery is essential.	If the fibula is minimally displaced, fixing only the tibia can be a normal approach.	A cast or brace alone is usually sufficient for most tib-fib fractures.	C

Hello,

My 3 year old daughter hasn't slept in two days. She has become EXTREMELY anxious out of nowhere, and she also happens to be constipated. We are in California.

Context(?):
On Tue night (today is Sun), we both had some flu symptoms. Mine went away within 12 hours with a broken out sweat at around 5am. She seemed to still be sick, but better, so I sent her to school. When I went to pick her up from preschool, the teacher said that she was acting very different/off and asking to sleep a lot, which made sense since we were both sick. She seemed better/not a concern by Thursday night.

Anyways, on Friday night I was woken up by her nonstop throughout the night. Probably 8-9 times of her just acting slightly out of character. She was asking for things she usually asks of me to help get her back down, but way too frequently and definitely got little to no sleep Fri night.

Last night (Sat) when I got home, my wife was ready to take her to the ER because she was apparently acting super strangely. She had spoken to the advice nurse and they recommend we go in, so we did. She was screaming/irrational/totally a wreck the whole time, and overly anxious of things that made no sense to be anxious about. We get home around 1:30-2 AM and I laid with her all night trying to get her to sleep.

As soon as she would be calm for a moment and start to relax, she jets up at full speed hyperventilating for a few breaths. She was worried about everything. Even her pillow eating her. She is acting schizo, and I couldn't be more concerned. She won't even drink out of a cup because she's worried about it spilling (she drinks out of cups all the time). But it's so bad that she hyperventilates and curls up in a ball if you try to bring the cup close to her. She is saying very weird things, and acting like a scary kid out of a movie with deadpan, ominous thoughts. 

Last night, she kept saying she needed to poo but didn't at all, but also didn't pee at all either, and hasn't for a good amount of time.

Any insights??

True	t_ggvvnl7-0	"Broke fall while snowboarding with only my chest

Hi,

Just discovered this sub as I am paranoid and desperate and would like a 2nd opinion (at least an informal one).

Age: 29

Height: 170 cm / 5'7""

Weight: 75 kilo / 165 lbs

Gender: male 

Smoker: once a week, but only weed (very small amount, not even 0.1 gram and with a dry vape pen)

Drinker: not really. maybe one or two drinks once a month

Existing issues:
 - headaches: most likely due to change I air pressure and I usually take 500g paracetamol, sleep it out or hot shower
- heart defect:Quadcuspid Aortic Vavlue (instead of tricuspid) seems healthy/normal otherwise but need to follow up once every 1-2 years 

Background: I went snowboarding on Monday after just beginning the slope (within the very first 5-6 seconds) my board bit the snow and I fell on snow (no rocks), with my chest and only my chest breaking my fall (idk why my hands didn't break the fall).

So, ever since that day, nearly every thing I do hurts, and is probably the most painful thing I have felt in my life, more than being kicked in the balls.
It doesn't matter if I breathe deeply, laugh or try to move my upper body in any way, it hurts like hell. It seems to slightly get better throughout the day, but after a nights sleep (on my back) all the pain comes back with full force; so much that it literally takes me 5 min to slowly get the courage to get out of bed because that is one of the worst moments thb. No visible signs of injury afaik.

I went to my emergency center (in Sweden, närakute) and the doctor only listened to my breathing, to see if my lungs were punctured, and then prescribed me some anti inflammatory (idk the name but she said twice a day with food). I just checked her notes online and all she wrote was: ""Contusion on the chest"". 


Obviously I'm not a doctor or anything else, but shouldn't I actually get a fucking xray at the very least or something? I mean maybe if something else is punctured or bleeding, then I'd actually be dead by now from internal bleeding, but still, how can this hurt so much without something being broken?"	"Doctor Question: If you're genuinely concerned and would like an x-ray you could always go back and ask them for one, I'm not sure how health care works in Sweden though so sorry if I'm wrong
