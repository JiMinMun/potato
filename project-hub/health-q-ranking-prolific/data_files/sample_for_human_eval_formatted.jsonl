I brushed off the heaviness as the weed I was smoking beforehand and the stomach sensation as just really needing to go to the washroom. I had just been in 10 minutes prior so I figured my stomach was just upset. I make it up the short steps and it gets worse. My mind connects the gut sensation to a few experiences where I pass out or feel like I am coming close. I should've just sat down right away but that requires good fore-thought. I get a few steps into the bathroom and then darkness...\n\nNext thing I know I am on the floor with my heart beating out of my chest, cold, covered in sweat, and towels. I cannot bring myself to open my eyes because of an overwhealming sound of blood circulating. All I can focus on for the next 30 seconds (but felt like an eternity) is the sound and how human are not supposed to hear it normally. I open my eyes, slowy sit up, and try to gather together what happened.

I was quite surprised when I uncovered the towel bar and saw my damage. I had bent the square folded metal pole into a near 90 degree angle with what I presume was my head. I take the pole out to the garage to show my dad and try to calm down. I get yelled at to go make a doc's appointment (Which I hate, the nurses are rude to me but nice to him) for the 23rd.\nI come back, I still have this overwhealming omen of fear over me (I still kind of do) and come back to calm down and smoke a bowl.

A few red bumps came up which is not too unusual for me. I then noticed smaller ones appearing on my labia and started to get worried. I had been in a jacuzzi a few nights before that had murky water (I have super sensitive skin, especially with chlorine) which I don't think is the problem. I also recently lost my virginity with my boyfriend. We didn't use a condom because I was on the pill and I trust he's clean. The only symptoms I have is being itchy and the red bumps. I've looked up STDs and there are so many other symptoms I don't have. Please help, I can't get to the doctor until next week and I'm starting to worry. Oh, there's also a bit of dry skin it looks like. Almost like the skin is flaking.\nDoctor: <br>", "<br><big><strong>Options for a follow-up question</strong></big>", "A.

The man had the audacity to prescribe **2x 500mg paractamol** and told us to **stop giving the resident Diclofenac because it would hurt his stomach more**... I cannot explain how angry I was. On top of that, he told us to only call him if the resident got a fever.\n\nSo my shift started, I discussed the situation with a fellow colleague who was equally as angry as I was (the resident was still extremely upset, hitting everything around him, quick surface breathing, we could easily see he was in pain.

We called the doctor again, after a few hours an assistant called back telling us the doctor prescribed **oxycodon** (5mg... but it's something to start with). He also allowed us to **decrease the tube feedings**; still the same speed, just 50% water 50% peptisorb. \nLater in the afternoon and evening he slept, slept and slept. He was calm, I guess. The whole day after him being admitted to hospital, there weren't any feces around his mouth or in his tube. Colleagues have pointed out that they would've recognized the smell of fecal vomiting, and because his feces are so thin, it could've been something else. But then again, the man takes in nothing but white/yellow peptisorb.

After having bloodwork done while sick, it’s come to light that my CRP level spiked to 49.9, and then back down to 0.77 when I’m healthy.\nHello everyone,\n\nI’m sorry for the long title, I just wanted to get as much info in as I could. My name is Aaron, I’m a 24 year old male, and I live in Canada. \n\nFor as far back as I can remember, I’ve been sick what I felt has been way more often than any of my friends. I didn’t realize at the time, but every single time I’ve been sick (aside from maybe the odd cold?) has been the EXACT SAME symptoms - this includes a fever of typically 38.9, a very sore throat, congestion, and a cough.\n\nInitially, my mom and I believed I was constantly getting strep throat over and over again, so I would be treated as if it was and it would eventually go away. Like I said I don’t have a ton of memory on everything back then because I didn’t think anything of it at the time.\n\nThen, we come to the last few years. I started to notice the pattern about 2 years ago when I first met my girlfriend. I got extremely sick like I usually do on New Years, and it lasted a couple of weeks like it usually does - but about 3 weeks later, I got sick again. Same symptoms. Fast forward to February, about a month later, I’m sick again with the same symptoms. March, about a month later again - same symptoms. April, about 3 weeks later, I’m sick again with the same symptoms as always.\n\nIt was around this time that my mom and I noticed that nobody ever gets sick from me. I’m never, ever contagious - it almost seems like my body’s reaction to something rather than an illness. \n\nThis pattern continued for about a year, up until last New Years when I got sick again. I finally had enough and I decided to go to a walk in and explain my situation. I met a doctor who finally was willing to look into what this could be, rather than just marking it off as a cold or strep throat. He gave me some forms to get bloodwork done once when I was healthy, and again when I was sick. \n\nI waited until I was sick to get my bloodwork done, but, to my surprise, I didn’t get sick this year until about 9 months later. Come October, sure enough i was sick with the same symptoms as always. I got my bloodwork done while I was sick, and to my surprise all of my results came back normal EXCEPT - I had a CRP level of 49.9. I’m lucky enough to be dating and living with my girlfriend who is a Registered Nurse, and she explained to me that a high CRP level indicates some sort of swelling in the body, and could really be chalked up to anything.\n\nSo, when I was healthy, I went back to get my blood work done. After getting it done, I went back into the same walk in clinic and spoke with the doctor who was willing to look into what it could be.\n\nHe explained to me that my CRP had spiked to 49.9 while I was sick, and had fallen back down to 0.77 while I was healthy. He said that usually with something like a cold or the flu, you could expect to see CRP levels of 13 or so due to a cough or a sore throat causing some swelling - but he said because it spiked to high, he thinks we could be on the right track and it could be something else.\n\nOne thing we’re looking into is something called Periodic Fever Syndrome. This is usually (rarely) found in children, and typically doesn’t last until adulthood. Some adults however can even more rarely be diagnosed with this.\n\nWith all of that being said, that brings me to today. I was sick about a month ago, and surprise surprise I’m sick again. Last night my fever started out at around 37.9 when I noticed it, and I woke up about an hour and a half ago with a fever of 38.8 (Celsius of course). \n\nI’m going to wait a few days, and when whatever this is is at its peak, I’m going to get bloodwork again to see if my CRP spikes back up again.

No reason behind my d dimer being high nothing...so my anxiety subsides for a night til dr google comes out in me of course. Now i'm experiencing what i feel is leg pain, and chest pain, but not when i deep breath...just looking if anyone has gone through anything similar? Would they be able to tell if i had any clots off of the blood work and the ct scan anywhere in my body? Do i have anything to stress about? Any advice is welcome...Thanks and i hope you guys have a good day!\n\nAlso fighting what feels like a sinus infection, our little one was just really sick with fever and stuff, i recently gave up alcohol afrer abusing it for quite some time...really looking for some help..\nDoctor: <br>", "<br><big><strong>Options for a follow-up question</strong></big>", "A.

{"id": "t_gh5t8bn-0-c0-q4", "context": "Patient: Infant girl three weeks of age has had two choking incidents , one of which made her spend her first Christmas in hospital.\nBit of a heavy one here, but I NEED advice.\n(Also sorry for the spelling and grammar I’m not the smartest when it comes to that stuff.)\n\nSo on the first of December I gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl. She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because ‘that’s how babies are designed ‘ , but they didn’t see it , they didn’t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things.\nNevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn’t of helped her.\n\nFast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again .

She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because ‘that’s how babies are designed ‘ , but they didn’t see it , they didn’t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things.\nNevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn’t of helped her.\n\nFast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.\n\nNow here’s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree! \nNow me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can’t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise.

She has become EXTREMELY anxious out of nowhere, and she also happens to be constipated. We are in California.\n\nContext(?):\nOn Tue night (today is Sun), we both had some flu symptoms. Mine went away within 12 hours with a broken out sweat at around 5am. She seemed to still be sick, but better, so I sent her to school. When I went to pick her up from preschool, the teacher said that she was acting very different/off and asking to sleep a lot, which made sense since we were both sick. She seemed better/not a concern by Thursday night.\n\nAnyways, on Friday night I was woken up by her nonstop throughout the night. Probably 8-9 times of her just acting slightly out of character. She was asking for things she usually asks of me to help get her back down, but way too frequently and definitely got little to no sleep Fri night.\n\nLast night (Sat) when I got home, my wife was ready to take her to the ER because she was apparently acting super strangely. She had spoken to the advice nurse and they recommend we go in, so we did. She was screaming/irrational/totally a wreck the whole time, and overly anxious of things that made no sense to be anxious about. We get home around 1:30-2 AM and I laid with her all night trying to get her to sleep.\n\nAs soon as she would be calm for a moment and start to relax, she jets up at full speed hyperventilating for a few breaths. She was worried about everything. Even her pillow eating her. She is acting schizo, and I couldn't be more concerned. She won't even drink out of a cup because she's worried about it spilling (she drinks out of cups all the time). But it's so bad that she hyperventilates and curls up in a ball if you try to bring the cup close to her. She is saying very weird things, and acting like a scary kid out of a movie with deadpan, ominous thoughts. \n\nLast night, she kept saying she needed to poo but didn't at all, but also didn't pee at all either, and hasn't for a good amount of time.\n\nAny insights??\n\nUpdate: It was not encephalitis!

She has become EXTREMELY anxious out of nowhere, and she also happens to be constipated. We are in California.\n\nContext(?):\nOn Tue night (today is Sun), we both had some flu symptoms. Mine went away within 12 hours with a broken out sweat at around 5am. She seemed to still be sick, but better, so I sent her to school. When I went to pick her up from preschool, the teacher said that she was acting very different/off and asking to sleep a lot, which made sense since we were both sick. She seemed better/not a concern by Thursday night.\n\nAnyways, on Friday night I was woken up by her nonstop throughout the night. Probably 8-9 times of her just acting slightly out of character. She was asking for things she usually asks of me to help get her back down, but way too frequently and definitely got little to no sleep Fri night.\n\nLast night (Sat) when I got home, my wife was ready to take her to the ER because she was apparently acting super strangely. She had spoken to the advice nurse and they recommend we go in, so we did. She was screaming/irrational/totally a wreck the whole time, and overly anxious of things that made no sense to be anxious about. We get home around 1:30-2 AM and I laid with her all night trying to get her to sleep.\n\nAs soon as she would be calm for a moment and start to relax, she jets up at full speed hyperventilating for a few breaths. She was worried about everything. Even her pillow eating her. She is acting schizo, and I couldn't be more concerned. She won't even drink out of a cup because she's worried about it spilling (she drinks out of cups all the time). But it's so bad that she hyperventilates and curls up in a ball if you try to bring the cup close to her. She is saying very weird things, and acting like a scary kid out of a movie with deadpan, ominous thoughts. \n\nLast night, she kept saying she needed to poo but didn't at all, but also didn't pee at all either, and hasn't for a good amount of time.\n\nAny insights??\n\nUpdate: It was not encephalitis! Just an post-infectious auto-immune response. Super random, can happen to anyone after a virus I guess.

She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because ‘that’s how babies are designed ‘ , but they didn’t see it , they didn’t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things.\nNevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn’t of helped her.\n\nFast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.\n\nNow here’s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree! \nNow me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can’t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise. I genuinely don’t know how I am meant to cope with this fear that she is going to die any second, I can’t enjoy any time with her because I’m so stressed even though I want to be able to enjoy being with her I just can’t over the past few days.

Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because ‘that’s how babies are designed ‘ , but they didn’t see it , they didn’t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things.\nNevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn’t of helped her.\n\nFast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.\n\nNow here’s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree! \nNow me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can’t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise. I genuinely don’t know how I am meant to cope with this fear that she is going to die any second, I can’t enjoy any time with her because I’m so stressed even though I want to be able to enjoy being with her I just can’t over the past few days. I don’t know what to do , does anybody have advice or has anyone been through similar experience?\nDoctor: <br>", "<br><big><strong>Options for a follow-up question</strong></big>", "A.

She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because ‘that’s how babies are designed ‘ , but they didn’t see it , they didn’t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things.\nNevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn’t of helped her.\n\nFast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.\n\nNow here’s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree! \nNow me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can’t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise. I genuinely don’t know how I am meant to cope with this fear that she is going to die any second, I can’t enjoy any time with her because I’m so stressed even though I want to be able to enjoy being with her I just can’t over the past few days. I don’t know what to do , does anybody have advice or has anyone been through similar experience?\nDoctor: <br>", "<br><big><strong>Options for a follow-up question</strong></big>", "A.

{"id": "t_hpttplp-0-c0-q0", "context": "Patient: My significant other's health has sharply deteriorated and after months we have no idea what it is.\nHello. My (24F) boyfriend, Paul (29M), and I are fairly active. We go on road trips every year with our main stops being prime hiking spots. Paul is 5'7'' and 230 pounds. Due to his southeast asian/pacific genetics, his entire family is on the heavier side, but Paul is just as active as I am and eats well.\n\nRecently, we have gone long distance. Paul returned to live with his parents due to the pandemic while I stayed where I was. I visited him in June 2021. At this point, Paul had few symptoms, but some new minor health issues. We went hiking around Lake Tahoe and Paul was a little more out of breath than usual. He hasn't needed to use his inhaler since he was a kid, and he had to use it on this trip. We attributed this to recent wildfires in the area and poor air quality.\n\nHowever, Paul's health continued to sharply deteriorate. We went to Edinburgh, Scotland, in July. While hiking Arthur's Seat, Paul had to use his inhaler so many times he emptied it out. He could not get it refilled as we were out of the country. Until the end of the trip, Paul's breathing became more and more labored and he developed a persistent cough.\n\nI did not visit Paul August-November 2021. We spoke on the phone and Skyped regularly. During this time, Paul would sometimes leave the call or mute for a few minutes. He'd come back and apologize, saying he'd had to cough pretty violently and didn't want me to hear. I was concerned. I overheard one wracking, moaning coughing session and knew it was not just asthma or an irritated throat. By October 2021, the air quality in his area had greatly improved.\n\nI persuaded Paul to visit his general practitioner. His GP dismissed all of his concerns and cited Paul's being fat and asthmatic as the source of his issues, and that the issues would disappear with rest and exercise. I had to fight doctors for years to get them to take my chronic pelvic pain seriously, and was finally diagnosed with an ovarian cyst that was 8mm long and about to burst, so I have experience with self advocacy in the medical space. I helped Paul see new doctors.\n\nIn mid-October 2021, Paul developed abdominal edema. Paul's feet, legs, and lower stomach were swelling up like crazy. He gained 40 pounds. He could barely move at all, even to go to the bathroom. He couldn't sleep lying down without suffocating, which only worsened his exhaustion. He went to the doctor again and was prescribed diuretics. The diuretics helped with the swelling and extra weight and within 2 weeks he was back to his regular weight, but the coughing and weakness persisted.\n\nAbout a month after regularly taking diuretics (November), Paul started feeling intense nausea on a weekly basis. This nausea would prompt coughing fits. Paul couldn't eat or focus while nauseated. Our calls became more and more infrequent as Paul's nausea and headaches grew. He told me sometimes the nausea would get so bad that he would vomit. There were no patterns to the vomiting--it didn't happen at a certain time of day or after meals. Sometimes it was foamy. He got a CT scan to look at his gall bladder and all results were within normal ranges. Blood tests, including labs for liver function, all came back normal. His doctor referred him to a gastroenterologist for more testing, but due to increases in COVID-19 cases, they haven't even processed his file, let alone scheduled appointments, which would be months out. A nurse anticipated he wouldn't be able to go in until February 2022, but at his rate of decline, this has me concerned for his mental wellbeing and life quality.\n\nThis week, in late December 2021, I visited him and his family for Christmas. I had heard from Paul about his issues and was following closely with his medical updates, but seeing it firsthand was another thing altogether. I have never seen human suffering and sickness like this up close or cared for another human being in such an intimate way.\n\nEvery single day, he has intense coughing fits and bouts of nausea where he makes vocalizations and gags, usually every few hours. At least once a day, these coughing fits are so bad that he spends 5-30 minutes vomiting in the sink. The vomiting has increased drastically. After this, the nausea alleviates, but Paul feels exhausted and has migraines. He barely eats. He barely sleeps.\n\nToday, he had three different nausea/coughing bouts that induced vomiting. One developed rapidly and he threw up in a restaurant bathroom. The last one, which just happened this evening as of writing this post, also caught him by surprise, and he vomited in the kitchen sink. The vomiting was so physically taxing that his nose bled profusely and he lost control of his bowels and peed himself. He was not strong enough to make it down the hall to the bathroom. Eventually, I assisted him into the shower. I am writing this before bed, and he is still coughing, and has a migraine. He hasn't gotten up from where he sat after taking the shower.\n\nI would appreciate any medical advice about what might be causing what Paul is going through, as well as tips for how to navigate the medical system to ensure this gets treated in the best way possible. I would like to reiterate that while neither of us are marathon running body builders, Paul (before all of this) was physically active and monitored his eating habits. He was also mentally active and had returned to school to pursue a degree in a new field. We both have families that are reasonably well off and are good support systems.\n\nPaul is one tough puppy, and reassures me that it \"isn't so bad,\" but after seeing it firsthand, I know this is not something that can continue the way it is. I am extremely worried, and caring for him is beginning to wear on me mentally. Sometimes I feel sympathy nausea when I hear the noises he makes in the bathroom.\n\nPlease help in any way possible. I appreciate any and every tip, and can provide additional information if needed. Thank you very much.\n\nUPDATE 12/26:\n\nWe went to the ER at 4 AM right after Christmas. Luckily, it was almost completely empty. I was not allowed to go back with him, so for the entire five hours I was sitting in the waiting room, I was only ever accompanied by one or two other people at a time.\n\nPaul's shortness of breath, fatigue, and wracking coughs got him seen quickly. He texted me updates as things progressed. He got every test I wrote down from these comments--BNP test, pulmonary work, chest x rays, GI work. An echocardigram is scheduled for next week.\n\nThey found out right away that Paul's BNP results were seven times higher than usual. They said this was indicative of heart failure. They also tested Paul for COVID 19. He tested negative, but did test indicating he had some kind of viral illness.\n\nPaul's doctor concluded that he was suffering from chronic RSV that was made worse by poor genetics, asthma, and obesity. Paul did confirm he had what felt like a respiratory illness in Scotland in June, then after going to a wedding in October, then this week when he got severely ill and we found out his mother had a cold.\n\nThere is no cure for RSV, but a vaccine has reached human trials. The only things Paul can do to alleviate his own suffering and avoid a heart attack is to make significant lifestyle changes and live like an immunocompromised person. I believe in his ability to achieve the former, but the latter is more difficult because of his emotionally overattached mother who brings the entire extended family out for lunches, movie nights, shopping, etc. several times a week. I'm concerned she won't take it seriously or will be in denial to avoid feeling responsible and will therefore continue to expose Paul to colds that could kill him.\n\nPaul is currently resting. He was given medication for his nausea and a new inhaler. He is doing better but still coughing. We have already started on his new food regimen. I am hoping for the best, but the pandemic has proved that people rarely take precautions for others' goodwill. Thank you for all your support.

After this, the nausea alleviates, but Paul feels exhausted and has migraines. He barely eats. He barely sleeps.\n\nToday, he had three different nausea/coughing bouts that induced vomiting. One developed rapidly and he threw up in a restaurant bathroom. The last one, which just happened this evening as of writing this post, also caught him by surprise, and he vomited in the kitchen sink. The vomiting was so physically taxing that his nose bled profusely and he lost control of his bowels and peed himself. He was not strong enough to make it down the hall to the bathroom. Eventually, I assisted him into the shower. I am writing this before bed, and he is still coughing, and has a migraine. He hasn't gotten up from where he sat after taking the shower.\n\nI would appreciate any medical advice about what might be causing what Paul is going through, as well as tips for how to navigate the medical system to ensure this gets treated in the best way possible. I would like to reiterate that while neither of us are marathon running body builders, Paul (before all of this) was physically active and monitored his eating habits. He was also mentally active and had returned to school to pursue a degree in a new field. We both have families that are reasonably well off and are good support systems.\n\nPaul is one tough puppy, and reassures me that it \"isn't so bad,\" but after seeing it firsthand, I know this is not something that can continue the way it is. I am extremely worried, and caring for him is beginning to wear on me mentally. Sometimes I feel sympathy nausea when I hear the noises he makes in the bathroom.\n\nPlease help in any way possible. I appreciate any and every tip, and can provide additional information if needed. Thank you very much.\n\nUPDATE 12/26:\n\nWe went to the ER at 4 AM right after Christmas. Luckily, it was almost completely empty. I was not allowed to go back with him, so for the entire five hours I was sitting in the waiting room, I was only ever accompanied by one or two other people at a time.\n\nPaul's shortness of breath, fatigue, and wracking coughs got him seen quickly. He texted me updates as things progressed. He got every test I wrote down from these comments--BNP test, pulmonary work, chest x rays, GI work. An echocardigram is scheduled for next week.\n\nThey found out right away that Paul's BNP results were seven times higher than usual. They said this was indicative of heart failure. They also tested Paul for COVID 19. He tested negative, but did test indicating he had some kind of viral illness.\n\nPaul's doctor concluded that he was suffering from chronic RSV that was made worse by poor genetics, asthma, and obesity. Paul did confirm he had what felt like a respiratory illness in Scotland in June, then after going to a wedding in October, then this week when he got severely ill and we found out his mother had a cold.\n\nThere is no cure for RSV, but a vaccine has reached human trials. The only things Paul can do to alleviate his own suffering and avoid a heart attack is to make significant lifestyle changes and live like an immunocompromised person. I believe in his ability to achieve the former, but the latter is more difficult because of his emotionally overattached mother who brings the entire extended family out for lunches, movie nights, shopping, etc. several times a week. I'm concerned she won't take it seriously or will be in denial to avoid feeling responsible and will therefore continue to expose Paul to colds that could kill him.\n\nPaul is currently resting. He was given medication for his nausea and a new inhaler. He is doing better but still coughing. We have already started on his new food regimen. I am hoping for the best, but the pandemic has proved that people rarely take precautions for others' goodwill. Thank you for all your support. Paul might never have gone to the ER if I hadn't visited and reached out to this community.\nDoctor: <br>", "<br><big><strong>Options for a follow-up question</strong></big>", "A.  very public place (at a Christmas market).<br>B.

They say definitively it is not APS.  🤷🏼‍♂️\n\nUpdate 2 (I don't think anyone is still checking this but just in case) - Tumor marker test was negative but they did find a precancerous polyp from the colonoscopy.\nDoctor: Yup, was wondering for their clotting disorders if they tested for connective tissue disease and things like antiphospholipid, lupus anticoagulant etc\nYes. They said i had a weak positive for APS. They dont think its that but said they were going to run some more tests but havent yet\nDoctor: <br>", "<br><big><strong>Options for a follow-up question</strong></big>", "A.

{"id": "t_drm2mhl-0-c0-q0", "context": "Patient: Smelling SO's bad breath but nobody else can?\nFor nearly a year my SO's breath has gotten worse and worse and it's ripping us apart. It's so bad it fills up any room they are in, it's nearly impossible to sleep next to them, I can smell it in the car if they have driven it that day. It's so bad today that even if they just walk into the same room as me it's faintly there from 10 feet away. I am unable to be intimate because of this, and I fear it's going to end our relationship.\n\nThey are diligent with brushing/flossing/mouthwash. They went to a GP in the spring that said he couldn't find anything wrong. We took a trip to the dentist and they said gums and teeth were OK, tongue seemed OK. My SO asked a few friends to smell their breath and nobody reported anything, although I'm not sure that's trustworthy (how awful would it be to tell your best friend their breath smelled extremely bad?) Tonsils have been removed, but no clear evidence of tonsil stones in the remaining tissue where they could grow. Had bloodwork done recently, not diabetes.\n\nThe only thing left seems to be to go to an ENT? \n\nMy opinion is that it's stress related. My SO has anxiety attacks, and I think that couples with the fact they got a promotion earlier this year and they are under immense stress. We've been together for years and they never had bad breath before. The breath issue corresponds with the promotion on a timeline. \n\nThe breath can fade in and out. It's slowly better on the weekend (usually) when they aren't thinking about work. Saturday night with friends and a beer and it seems to subside. Likewise, Monday night it's back full force. Same goes now leading up to the holidays. \n\nThe other option seems to be that it's phantosmia on my part. Evidence to this could be that when this became an issue in the spring, I did ask one of my parents to smell for my SO's breath on a visit. They reported nothing, but during the visit the breath had faded nearly completely. This is also true for the aforementioned trip to the dentist. \n\nTL;DR: SO's breath smells so bad I can't be in the same room with them. SO cannot smell it, their friends say they can't smell it, and any time I try to get a neutral third party to detect it, it goes away to a level that's not going to be smelled by someone who isn't in kissing proximity.\n\nWhat could this be?

I am unable to be intimate because of this, and I fear it's going to end our relationship.\n\nThey are diligent with brushing/flossing/mouthwash. They went to a GP in the spring that said he couldn't find anything wrong. We took a trip to the dentist and they said gums and teeth were OK, tongue seemed OK. My SO asked a few friends to smell their breath and nobody reported anything, although I'm not sure that's trustworthy (how awful would it be to tell your best friend their breath smelled extremely bad?) Tonsils have been removed, but no clear evidence of tonsil stones in the remaining tissue where they could grow. Had bloodwork done recently, not diabetes.\n\nThe only thing left seems to be to go to an ENT? \n\nMy opinion is that it's stress related. My SO has anxiety attacks, and I think that couples with the fact they got a promotion earlier this year and they are under immense stress. We've been together for years and they never had bad breath before. The breath issue corresponds with the promotion on a timeline. \n\nThe breath can fade in and out. It's slowly better on the weekend (usually) when they aren't thinking about work. Saturday night with friends and a beer and it seems to subside. Likewise, Monday night it's back full force. Same goes now leading up to the holidays. \n\nThe other option seems to be that it's phantosmia on my part. Evidence to this could be that when this became an issue in the spring, I did ask one of my parents to smell for my SO's breath on a visit. They reported nothing, but during the visit the breath had faded nearly completely. This is also true for the aforementioned trip to the dentist. \n\nTL;DR: SO's breath smells so bad I can't be in the same room with them. SO cannot smell it, their friends say they can't smell it, and any time I try to get a neutral third party to detect it, it goes away to a level that's not going to be smelled by someone who isn't in kissing proximity.\n\nWhat could this be? And what doctor should we go to?\n\nUPDATE: I've now confirmed this appears to be stress related as we have been on vacation for a while now, away from work, and the smell is GONE. What doctor do we go to?\nDoctor: <br>", "<br><big><strong>Options for a follow-up question</strong></big>", "A. Do you find any pleasure in bringing up your partner's bad breath?<br>B.

A few red bumps came up which is not too unusual for me. I then noticed smaller ones appearing on my labia and started to get worried. I had been in a jacuzzi a few nights before that had murky water (I have super sensitive skin, especially with chlorine) which I don't think is the problem. I also recently lost my virginity with my boyfriend. We didn't use a condom because I was on the pill and I trust he's clean. The only symptoms I have is being itchy and the red bumps. I've looked up STDs and there are so many other symptoms I don't have. Please help, I can't get to the doctor until next week and I'm starting to worry.
